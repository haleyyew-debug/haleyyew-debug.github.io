(May 27, 2021) But as the pandemic recedes in the United States, there is renewed interest by the scientific and journalistic communities about the origins of the virus and whether it could have escaped from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). According to Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper: “One of the Chinese researchers, Feihu Yan, from the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Academy of Military Medical Sciences, worked for a period of time at the Winnipeg lab, a Level 4 facility equipped to handle some of the world’s deadliest diseases.”  There were at least seven Chinese scientists at the lab. Two of them, “Xiangguo Qiu and her biologist husband, Keding Cheng, were fired in January (2021) after the Canadian Security Intelligence Service … recommended that their security clearances be removed on national security grounds,” allegedly for sending samples of deadly viruses to the Wuhan lab.

(May 27, 2021) Germany's BioNTech asked Taiwan to remove the word "country" from theirplanned joint announcement on a COVID-19 vaccine sale to the island, its health minister said, as he outlined the collapse of the deal which Taipei blames on China. <i> And who’s asking Germany to ask this? </i> (Yimou Lee; Taiwan says request to drop word 'country' preceded BioNTech vaccine deal collapse — Reuters) <br>

(May 26, 2021) “We almost closed a deal with BioNTech, but we have not been able to sign the contract because of China’s involvement,” Tsai said in a Facebook post on Wednesday after meeting members of her ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Chinese company Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which has an exclusive deal with BioNTech to supply vaccines to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, previously said it was willing to sell the vaccines to Taipei. <i> Possibly an interference in the supply chain. </i> (China blocking BioNTech purchase, says Taiwan President Tsai — Apple Daily) <br>

(May 25, 2021) As China's geopolitical prominence is cemented abroad while authoritarian pressures grow at home, the CCP claims to have delivered the modernity and prosperity Chinese people have dreamed of for over a century. By contrast, the China of 2021 is an emerging superpower. Beijing has a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, a nuclear arsenal and the world's second-largest economy. The CCP continues to claim full credit for these accomplishments. <i> The hardworking Chinese people should claim credit for the accomplishments instead. </i> (At 100, Chinese Communist Party claims credit for the Chinese dream — Axios) <br>

(May 25, 2021) The original investigation by a team of scientists assembled by the World Health Organization and China's government returned inconclusive findings in March and was criticized by top officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken. <i> Criticism is not enough. People are spending too much time on criticisms. </i> The report identified the four possible origins of the virus: Direct zoonotic spillover, which was deemed "possible to likely;" Introduction through an intermediate host, regarded as 'likely to very likely; Introduction through cold/ food chain products, which was considered to be "possible" and; "Introduction through a laboratory incident" — which the WHO team said was "extremely unlikely. <i> WHO extremely likely being threatened by spies with espionage and terrorist attacks. </i> (HHS chief calls for follow-up investigation into COVID origins — Axios) <br>

(May 25, 2021) In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was pleased to see the close exchanges and interactions between the U.S. Embassy and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan, and looked forward to continuing to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with like-minded countries. <i> But TECRO cannot represent the government of Taiwan. Arsenal buildup on the coasts forces Taiwan officials to stay out. </i> The Department of State earlier announced the latest guidelines for exchanges with Taiwan based on the 2020 Taiwan Assurance Act, to encourage Washington to increase engagement with Taipei for the deepening of bilateral unofficial relations.

(May 25, 2021) A camera system that uses AI and facial recognition intended to reveal states of emotion has been tested on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the BBC has been told. He provided evidence of how the AI system is trained to detect and analyse even minute changes in facial expressions and skin pores. According to his claims, the software creates a pie chart, with the red segment representing a negative or anxious state of mind. <i> Possibly also referring to the attack on private properties, where they use the hacked sensors to generate charts that measures someone’s emotional state. </i> "Uyghur life is now about generating data," he said. The group has also found a document which appears to suggest the firm was developing technology for a so-called One Person, One File system. "For each person the government would store their personal information, their political activities, relationships... anything that might give you insight into how that person would behave and what kind of a threat they might pose," said IPVM's Conor Healy. <i> The study is not only observational, it is experimental. Subjects are attacked by bioweapons, and their responses are recorded, procedures similar to Imperial Japanese concentration camps. </i> The UK's Chinese embassy had a more robust defence, telling the BBC: "There is no so-called facial recognition technology featuring Uyghur analytics whatsoever." <i> Legally, companies can deny everything they are being accused of. </i> China is estimated to be home to half of the world's almost 800 million surveillance cameras. It also has a large number of smart cities, such as Chongqing, where AI is built into the foundations of the urban environment. "With artificial intelligence we have nowhere to hide," he said. <i> Hacked phone networks also provide the coordinates of someone outside, while other people get the coordinates, come close to intimidate. </i> (AI emotion-detection software tested on Uyghurs — BBC) <br>

(May 25, 2021) Hundreds of thousands of people across the Australian state of Queensland were left without electricity after an explosion at a power station.

(May 24, 2021) The latest wave of disinformation differed from previous attacks, Lin said, because they were presented as messages issued by government authorities or known media outlets, making the fake information more convincing to an unsuspecting public, he said. Lin predicted that fake news will become a new normal, and he suggested that the government should always be ready to dispel the stories through credible channels after they emerge. <i> Chinese citizens endured this for decades, their normal has gone global. </i> (Fake news may be Beijing 'pressure test' against Taiwan: experts — CNA) <br>

(May 24, 2021) Chinese state media accused the United States of ignoring diplomatic protocol by attempting to open a dialogue between military officials in the two countries, an attempt that was rebuffed by China. <i> What they call ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy, and what we call ‘thug’ diplomacy. </i> (Diplomatic protocol ignored when US approached Chinese military: state media — Apple Daily) <br>

(May 24, 2021) The Chinese government has developed a sophisticated set of disinformation tools that it is deploying inside liberal democracies. Broadly speaking, the messaging promoted by Beijing-linked actors suggested that democracy had failed in Taiwan, while using false coronavirus claims in an attempt to disrupt political processes and degrade social trust. The researchers analyzed thousands of posts to determine their origin, purpose, effect, audience, and how the disinformation was disseminated. They categorized Beijing's efforts into four types of "attack modes:" Propaganda mode: Distorted information broadcasted by news outlets, either Chinese state media or news outlets that have received hidden financial or other incentives to repackage China's propaganda as legitimate news. Pink mode: Mobilizing Chinese nationalists online to post and amplify disinformation. Content farm mode: Using websites that aggregate low-quality, high-engagement articles to amplify and spread disinformation, often through Facebook, YouTube, and other social media platforms. Collaboration mode: Working closely with real online influencers in the target country to get them to share the desired messages through their platforms. "Taiwan has been flagged as a testing ground for the PRC's worldwide propaganda and information warfare," the report authors write. "China's information operations are profoundly effective in the wars over culture, values, and governance" in Taiwan, the authors wrote, "sowing division in Taiwanese society, pushing groups into echo chambers, and attacking fundamental democratic values." (Beijing flooded Taiwan with coronavirus disinformation — Axios) <br>

(May 24, 2021) The State Department acknowledged in January 2021 the "United States government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019." It found that they'd experienced symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 "and common seasonal illness." <i> Just to refresh people’s memory. </i> "No, actually," Fauci said. "I am not convinced about that, I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened." (US learned several Wuhan lab researchers sickened before COVID-19 outbreak — Fox News) <br>

(May 24, 2021) China’s unilateral construction of roads, settlements and buildings within Bhutan’s territory contradicts the 1998 peace agreement signed by the two countries. That agreement promised to “maintain peace and tranquillity on the Bhutan-China border areas.” What makes matters more complicated for Bhutan is that the area in which Gyalaphug lies is not just ordinary territory. Rather, it is in an area of extraordinary religious significance to the people of Bhutan. In fact, it is speculated that China does not actually need the land it is settling in Bhutan; rather, it aims to coerce the Bhutanese government into surrendering territory in other parts of the country to give China a strategic advantage against India. Gyalaphug now is one of three new villages China has constructed in northern Bhutan. (India must rethink strategy against China’s expansion — Asia Times) <br>

(May 24, 2021) Pope Francis called on believers worldwide to pray for the church in China on Sunday, after celebrating Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica. His message came as Chinese authorities arrested more than a dozen pastors, priests and seminarians and deployed over 100 officers to remove crosses from churches as part of its latest nationwide crackdown.

(May 24, 2021) A 97-year-old Holocaust survivor received a series of hate-fueled messages on social media during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, her family says, according to reports. But Ebert's great-grandson, Dov Forman, said her pages were recently flooded with hate-fueled messages, including some praising Hitler. "As the violence between Israel and Hamas continues to escalate, we are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate. We are tracking acts of harassment, vandalism, and violence as well as a torrent of online abuse. It’s happening around the world— from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like NYC and in small towns, and across every social media platform," the statement read. The organizations said between May 7 and May 14, more than 17,000 tweets were found that used variations of the phrase, "Hitler was right," according to the news website.

(May 23, 2021) China had earlier last week already announced that it would step up measures around commodity supply, saying it would curb "unreasonable" prices. <i> Lots of ways to manipulate prices. </i> Commodity traders are also cautious after The White House said on Friday that it had cut back its infrastructure bill from $2.25tn to $1.7tn. With cuts to the spending plan being in broadband, roads and bridges, demand for iron ore and copper could be curbed. US Republicans dismissed the changes as insufficient for a deal, which could also mean that further cuts to the proposed investments are imminent.

(May 23, 2021) “The moment you allow the US military bases in the country, China will interpret it as an extension of the US Indo-pacific strategy, which they consider [a] China containment strategy and may roll back the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and withdraw other facilities including soft loans, military cooperation and diplomatic support,” he said. The history of US-Pakistan military cooperation dates back to 1959 when then-military dictator General Ayub Khan allowed US forces to use the Badaber airbase in Peshawar for intelligence-gathering and spying on the erstwhile Soviet Union. These bases gave US forces logistical support for their units in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom from 2001 to 2014. <i> Maybe more bases in Pakistan can provide support to combat terrorism. </i> (Will Pakistan give US post-Afghanistan military bases? — Asia Times) <br>

(May 23, 2021) All told, you've been unable to sit down to a meal in a Toronto restaurant for just over 360 days. Compare that with Paris (over 260 days), London (259 days) or Hong Kong (2 days). The restaurant scene in others cities fared differently. In Singapore and Seoul, indoor dining has remained open the entire pandemic, although curfews and limits on the number of people inside have greatly reduced it. <i> In the experiments, each subject receives a different treatment. Had strange dreams yesterday, the first one, CN tower was destroyed and being rebuilt in my living room; second one, a girl was in a lecture hall, then hall raided by terrorists, and girl got kidnapped and mutilated. </i> (Toronto lockdown: A year without indoor dining — BBC) <br>

(May 23, 2021) Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform important cryptographic tasks — essentially getting information from A to B, in a secure manner. The best known example of this is QKD which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem. That encryption would be bonded by physics rather than cryptography — an encryption so strong that the very act of intrusion would break the connection which may instantly be re-established using a new quantum key. Then in May 2019, US President Donald Trump announced that Huawei — along with several other Chinese companies — was now on something called the Entity List.

Paraguay is also among the handful of countries that recognize the self-governing territory of Taiwan as a sovereign nation. The South American country did not join the appeal to the WHO.

The event will underscore what a senior administration official on Thursday described as an ironclad commitment to the United States-South Korea alliance dating back to the particularly bloody war between 1950 and 1953, which left the peninsula divided.

SIA noted that based on their current published schedules, the group expects the passenger capacity to be around 28 per cent of pre-Covid levels by June 2021.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, General Xu was named Chief of Staff of the army, and he later served as Defense Minister as well. He joined the Communist Party in 1927 and shortly afterward was a leader of the failed Guangzhou uprising. In the late 30's, General Xu set up revolutionary bases to harass Japanese occupation forces, and in the 40's he led troops that inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese Nationalists in the latter stages of the Chinese civil war.

As defense minister, he kept alive Mao's idea of a "people's army," but argued for a well-trained, well-equipped military force. He also advocated use of foreign military technology, a departure from China's policy of self-sufficiency. To win support for his views, he made alarming predictions of imminent Soviet aggression.

(May 17, 2021) Mining officials say the search has been focusing on possible deposits in Tikus, on southern Sumatra’s tin-rich island of Belitung, in Hatapang in central North Sumatra and in Aceh’s Tigapuluh mountain range. But that may be more for public consumption than anything. Indonesia has everything else needed for lithium batteries: world-leading reserves of nickel — and associated cobalt– in Sulawesi and Maluku, manganese in East Nusa Tenggara, graphite deposits in Southeast Sulawesi, some vanadium in western Java and rare earths in the tin-mining waste of Bangka and Belitung. The largest is Talison Lithium, 240 kilometers south of Perth, a joint venture between Albermarle Corp, a US chemical company, and China’s Tianqi Lithium, which effectively controls 46% of the global production of lithium. The two partners are spending US$1.2 billion on three lithium hydroxide plants due to come on stream in 2021-22. China’s dominant role in the industry worries Washington, which recently announced a $30 million research project to ensure that American business has access to a sustained domestic supply of lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earth minerals. China produces about 170,000 tonnes of lithium and currently controls about 80% of the lithium-ion battery supply chain. But because of its high consumption rate, it also imported large amounts of the material to supplement domestic production. <i> The focus now is not competition, but whether the authorities controlling the industries have malicious intents of weaponizing the products made. </i> Tsingshan is now the world’s largest stainless steel producer, reporting $260 billion in sales and operating a supply chain that incorporates mining and nickel pig iron smelting through to stainless steel smelting and related product manufacturing.

(May 16, 2021) It was very different in 2018, when house prices in some areas of New District rose by more than 50 per cent in just a few days after a historic summit between North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un and his southern counterpart Moon Jae-in at the end of April. Throughout that year, the growing sense of detente on the Korean peninsula – marked also by Kim’s first visits to China and his unprecedented meeting with then US president Donald Trump – gave Dandong, with a population of just 2.5 million, the biggest house price surge in the country, which continued into 2019. <i> Such a strange narrative. </i> “There’s no plunging of property prices, showing expectations have not changed.

(May 15, 2021) A group of high-profile scientists published a letter calling for renewed investigation into the origins of COVID-19 — including the theory that it spilled out of a virology lab. In a contentious exchange with Sen.

(May 14, 2021) An Ohio man and rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China was sentenced to 37 months in prison for making false statements to federal authorities as part of an immunology research fraud scheme. As part of his sentence, Zheng was also ordered to pay more than $3.4 million in restitution to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and approximately $413,000 to The Ohio State University. Song Guo Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight in order to flee to China. Zheng pleaded guilty last November and admitted he lied on applications in order to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from NIH to develop China’s expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology. “In yet another case involving the Chinese government’s Thousand Talents program, Song Guo Zheng will spend the next 37 months in a federal prison because he chose to lie and hide his involvement in this program from U.S. research funding agencies,” said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department’s National Security Division. (University Researcher Sentenced to Prison for Lying on Grant Applications to Develop Scientific Expertise for China — DOJ) <br>

(May 14, 2021) Guizhou’s data center building spree was under the news radar until Guizhou-Cloud’s servers and Apple’s iCloud storage and computing platform were hooked together in a deal announced in 2017. The hook-up had many users of Apple’s hit products wondering if Beijing sought to surveil their online communications and activities. Although Apple has vowed full compliance with local laws and regulations, it is still not allowed to take full ownership of the data centers in Guizhou due to Chinese laws that require a local joint venture partner. In comparison, Apple’s backbone data nodes in America and Europe are all wholly owned and operated by the company. (Deep inside China’s Big Tech data caves — Asia Times) <br>

(May 14, 2021) Japan has unearthed at least 700 Chinese-funded instances of plots of land changing hands near military bases, in a government investigation prompted by security concerns, a newspaper reports.

(May 13, 2021) Eric Li, the founding chairperson of Geely Holdings — the parent company of Geely Auto, China’s largest private car manufacturer — invested US$10 billion to help the 94-year-old automaker survive the global financial crisis in 2008. Volvo abandoned its merger plan with Geely Holdings in February, with both companies choosing to maintain their existing independent company structures. But it was apparently not enough to quell Volvo employees’ concerns about having to move its headquarters to mainland China, and even to share its decades-long car-making technology with the Chinese military. Some openly said that they were worried that their designs might have to follow the instructions of the Chinese senior management. With the trend of global containment of China, some Swedish officials have said they are also examining the relationship with China in all areas.

"Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment." The dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin. China accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world, according to recent research. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found. (Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin over climate concerns, says Musk — BBC) <br>

(May 12, 2021) Among the 630 cases where it was, at least 304 of the clerics appeared to have been sent to prison, as opposed to the network of "re-education" camps most closely associated with China's mass detention of the Uyghurs. Where information was available from court documents or testimony about the length of the prison sentence, the punishments reflect the harsh nature of Xinjiang justice: 96% sentenced to at least five years and 26% to 20 years or more, including 14 life sentences. <i> Which also explains why people want to free Tibet . </i> According to the arrest notice for Oken Mahmet, a 51-year-old Kazakh imam from Qaba in Xinjiang, Mahmet was charged with "propagating extremism". According to testimony collated by the Xinjiang Victims Database, his family says he was arrested for leading Friday prayers and officiating marriages at a mosque. <i> </i> The official was accused of allowing Ayup's son to visit him at a hospital detention facility after he was arrested. The court document refers to Ayup, who was 88 when he was detained in 2017, as a "religious extremist". Ayup's niece Maryam Muhammad told the BBC the imam was a "kind, hardworking, charitable man, cultured and knowledgeable, who encouraged young people to study not only religion but all the school subjects". Muhammad, who is now in the US, said nearly 60 members of her extended family had been detained since Ayup's arrest, including her husband and all of the imam's eight children. <i> Minute details are often the reason. </i> The real reason imams were being targeted was "because of their ability to bring people together in the community", said Peter Irwin, senior programme officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. <i> Anyone potentially influential is targeted. </i> In the early 2000s, many imams were compelled to attend formalised education courses that foreshadowed the mass "re-education" programmes pursued today against the general population. <i> Possibly for political training. </i> Nurgazy Malik, a father of two, graduate of the official Xinjiang Islamic Institute and editor-in-chief of a state-approved religious magazine, reportedly died in detention in November 2018. <i> More vulnerable if you are within their system. </i> According to Bunin, only 7,714 criminal verdicts are available for Xinjiang for 2018, despite the region logging 74,348 criminal cases that year. The near total absence of verdicts on charges typically levied against religious Uyghurs, like "propagating extremism" and "inciting separatism", suggests China is intentionally scrubbing the record. <i> If people find out about the truth, situations will deteriorate rapidly. </i> (Uyghur imams targeted in China's Xinjiang crackdown — BBC) <br>

(November 1992) Me: What happened to Syra? Syreen: Ah... the death of our world. This subject is very difficult for us, Captain but I will try to recount those sad days. Like your solar system, ours had a large population of comets and asteroids. Large meteor impacts, though rare, were not unheard of on our planet. So it was not a total shock when an asteroid penetrated our atmosphere and hit the surface. What was odd was that unlike most other meteors, this one was not pulverized on impact. It penetrated the crust, and indeed went all the way through to the mantle causing a major caldera... kind of a super volcano. The earthquakes caused by the impact were severe. The magma pumped out of the caldera wreaked significant damage on the nearby terrain but within a few weeks, it had cooled, forming a solid rock bandage over the wound. Within a few months we had cleaned up the mess, the caldera was calming down nicely and things were pretty much back to normal. Then, just over a year after the impact, all hell broke loose on the surface of Syra. Huge calderas were opening all over... not just around the meteor impact, but everywhere! The scope of the disaster is impossible to imagine Entire cities sliding into oceans of molten lava kilometer-wide sections of land being instantly pulverized by cataclysmic explosions and clouds of poison gas and superheated steam creating a death shroud around Syra. Me: What if I told you that Mycon Deep Children shatter planet crusts... like your Syra? Syreen: What?! What did you say?! Human, you had better not be joking. Syra is not a subject for Earth humor. Now what do you mean, shatter planet crusts? How? That IS what happened to Syra, yes, but we presumed it was a natural cataclysm... a meteor. Do you have proof that it was something else... these Deep Children? Me: I don't have proof YET, but I am certain the Mycon destroyed your world. Syreen: Captain, if what you say is true, it would turn my universe upside down. You have no sorrow to match what each of us Syreen feels every day of our lives when we remember what we have lost... Syra... our Eden. The very idea that the Mycon, or any alien race, may have been responsible for Syra's destruction fills me with BURNING RAGE!... then I want to lash out and STRIKE the viewer! It it were true, none of us here would rest until we had avenged ourselves on the perpetrators. We would find some way to leave this starbase, locate our starships, and hunt down the evil monsters! Captain, if you ever gather proof of what you say, you MUST inform us immediately. but until then... do not mention the subject again. It is too painful. (Star Control 2) <br>

(November 1992) No doubt you are familiar with an alien race called the Umgah who live in the Orionis constellation. While they are renowned for their potent and often cruel sense of humor they have outdone themselves in recent years. Specifically, they have used an unusual HyperWave Caster to impersonate the Ilwrath gods, Dogar and Kazon. When the Ilwrath began tuning-in to `the voices of their gods' on their hyperwave receivers their priest caste was understandably skeptical and counselled their many followers to ignore the blasphemous signals. However, in a surprise move, the majority of the Ilwrath then rose up and slaughtered the entire priest caste. Their reasons for this ghastly move included over-taxation, lack of `quality death in ceremony' and the general feeling that the priests had made Dogar and Kazon's pronouncements overly complex.

They would like to find you but they are blind to your presence... unless you show yourselves. (Star Control 2) <br>

(November 1992) Suddenly, the Utwig were stunned by a collective realization! All immediately and urgently donned veils of every description! Hides, leaves, shells, rocks even living drells were donned in the early days. You see, the face is the mechanism that expresses many of the primitive qualities that hinder sentience. Now rid of constant reminders of greed, rage, hatred, and lust the wisdom of the Utwig was no longer hampered by constant reminders of the primitive urge. Over many generations mask etiquette was refined to a rock-solid foundation of our society. Sure, the Morality Riots were expensive both in lives and infrastructure but the result was better mask regulation; specification from your basic Mask of Gruelling but Neccessary Activity to the most highly decorated Countenance of Stellar Representation. These were clearly defined. Recognizing the importance of flexibility, clear-cut and efficient procedures for revision and redesign dealt with the few anomalies. From that moment when we covered the source of our intellectual oppression we knew that it was a grand purpose that defined our destiny. (Star Control 2) <br>

The Kohr-Ah are immune to reason, having long ago lost the ability to see their situation objectively. They live in a self-maintained paradox: to ensure their safety and security the Kohr-Ah fight an endless battle against all other sentient species. (Star Control 2) <br>
