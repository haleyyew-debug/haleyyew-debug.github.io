(December 23, 2020) BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was looking "very likely" the two sides were "heading towards" an agreement. But this was "not signed and sealed", with "haggling" going on, she added. The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its "star chamber" of lawyers - which was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU - to analyse any deal that is reached. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would "scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom".

(December 23, 2020) If Congress does not override Mr Trump's veto in this case it would be the first time in 60 years that the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) does not become law. The defence bill sets the Pentagon's policy. It also determines decisions affecting weapons, personnel, troop deployments and other security measures. A number of military initiatives will stall if the bill does not become law. (Trump vetoes 'unconstitutional' defence bill — BBC) <br>

(December 23, 2020) For the four years of the Trump Presidency, the EU has been isolated as an international force looking to defend press freedom. And the bloc routinely fails to hold China to account for its rights record, as it seeks to build trade relations with the repressive superpower. In 2015, a CPJ special report noted how the EU’s international diplomacy lacked consistency and was open to accusations of double standards, for being too soft on repressive governments who are at the same time trade partners or strategic allies. In order for renewed cooperation to bear fruit however, the U.S. must first contend with its own recent record on press freedom. Both the U.S. and the EU should now examine where international coordination can yield the greatest impact, including by pressuring some of the world’s most intransigent autocrats.

(December 22, 2020) Reuters reported last week that Huawei Marine, recently divested from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and now majority-owned by another Chinese firm, submitted bids priced at more than 20% lower than two rivals for the $72.6 million project funded by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The cable project is designed to improve communications to the remote Pacific island nations of Micronesia, Nauru and Kiribati, although it has reached an impasse at the bid assessment stage, two sources with direct knowledge of the project details told Reuters. “The Chinese Communist Party subsidizes companies such as Huawei to ensure they are able to undercut all competitors, and then uses infrastructure installed by those companies to advance the CCP’s campaigns of espionage and geopolitical coercion,” the letter said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The cable project, which offers far greater data capacity than satellites, is particularly sensitive because it is designed to connect to the HANTRU-1 undersea cable, which is primarily used by the U.S. government and lands at Guam, a U.S. territory with substantial military assets. (Senators Cruz, Rubio warn Pacific ally on Chinese bid for undersea cable project — Reuters) <br>

(December 22, 2020) But in Tuesday night's message from the White House, the Republican president baulked at spending in the bill on other countries, arguing that the money should go to struggling Americans. Mr Trump concluded: "Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests, while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn't their fault. It was China's fault. If the president vetoes the legislation the US government could shut down on 29 December because the package was attached to a $1.4tn spending measure to fund federal agencies for the next nine months.

(December 22, 2020) On Friday, Washington added dozens of Chinese companies, including top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd., to a trade blacklist. He said DHS was also reviewing the activities of Chinese television maker TCL Electronics Holdings. Wolf said it had been discovered this year that the firm had "incorporated backdoors into all its TV sets, exposing users to cyber breaches and data exfiltration."

(December 22, 2020) Data collected by search engine Baidu, e-commerce giant Alibaba and social media company Tencent was the main reason behind President Xi Jinping’s calls for anti-monopoly measures during a recent economic meeting, said Liu Meng-chun, a research director at Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research in Taiwan. Chinese authorities have been seeking such information to carry out their social surveillance operations, Liu said. Chinese leaders were worried that real estate bubbles and local government debts would undermine the stability of the financial market, Liu said. The mainland’s jobless rate could be higher than the estimated 5%, Liu said. This year has been a difficult time for mainland university graduates seeking jobs, Ding said.

(December 22, 2020) The South Korean military said in a statement the Chinese military had informed South Korea that its planes were carrying out routine training before the Chinese aircraft entered the KADIZ. Four Chinese warplanes entered the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ) followed by 15 Russian aircraft, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). South Korea and Japan, which both scrambled jets to intercept the patrol at the time, accused Russia and China of violating their airspace.

(December 21, 2020) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she supported the virus relief bill even though it did not include the direct aid for state and local governments that Democrats had sought. It has a net cost of roughly $350 billion US for coronavirus relief, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said, adding that more than $500 US billion in funding comes from unspent money Congress had authorized. The legislation also expands a small-business lending program by about $284 billion US and steers money to schools, airlines, transit systems and vaccine distribution. The small-business loan and grant program, known as the Paycheck Protection Program, would exclude publicly traded companies from eligibility.

(September 1, 2020) High-level contacts are an important means to exchange views on the international security environment, to identify areas of common interest, to manage differences,  and  to  facilitate  common  approaches  to  shared  challenges.  Discussion of military cooperation and candidly  addressed differences. Recurring  exchanges  form  the  backbone  of  U.S.China  defense  discussions each  year. They serve as  regularized  mechanisms  for  dialogue  at the strategic  and policy  levels  on risk reduction, crisis  communication, and areas  for  cooperation. Functional  engagements  focus  on  advancing  risk  reduction, understanding,  and  communication  channels  to promote  deconfliction  and  coordination.  Functional exchanges  such  as  port  calls  are  also  used  to  enhance  operational  safety  and  exercise  communications and navigation protocols.

(September 1, 2020) However, actual military expenses are difficult to calculate, largely because of China’s poor accounting transparency. Focus  ar aerospace  engines — including  turbofan  technology — and  gas  turbines;  quantum  communications  and computing;  innovative  electronics  and  software;  automation  and  robotics;  special  materials  and applications;  nanotechnology;  neuroscience,  neural  resea rch,  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI). China  also  is  applying  substantial R&D resources  to  nuclear  fusion,  hypersonic  weapons  technology,  and  the  deployment  and  hardening of its  exp anding  multipurpose satellite constellation. Along  with  the  Science  and Technology  Commission,  the  steering  committee  will  spearhead  S&T  innovation  by  advising  the CMC on early stage research projects. China emphasizes  assimilating  private  sector  innovation  into  the  defenseindustrial  base. CAS  works  closely  with  NSFC,  and  much  of  its  work  contributes to  products  for  military  use.  The  NSFC  and  CMC Science  and  Technology  Commission  are  key advisers  on  emerging  and  disruptive  technologies  and  signed  a  fiveyear agreement  in  August  2016  to  collaborate  on  civil strategic  cooperation military  innovation  and  basic  research  for  national defense. The  PRC  is  pursuing  a  whole-of society  effort to  become  a  global  leader  in  AI,  which  includes  designating  select  private  AI  companies  in  China  as “AI champions”  to  emphasize  R&D  in  specific  dualuse  technologies. The  Next  Generation  AI Plan  details  China’s  AI  strategy  and  outlines  China’s  goals  of  using  c ommercial  and  military  entities  to gain  parity  with  the  world  leaders  in  AI  by  2020. Most of China’s missile programs, including its ballistic and cruise missile systems, are comparable in quality to other international top-tier producers. China’s two largest state-owned shipbuilders—the China State Shipbuilding Corporation and the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, merged in November 2019 creating the world’s largest shipbuilder as measured by production capacity. In  addition  to  presenting  an  economic  challenge  to  nations  that  export  hightech products,  the  plan  directly  supports  China’s  military  modernization  goals  by  stressing  proprietary mastery  of  advanced  dualuse  technologies.  China’s  leaders  ha ve  used  less  inflammatory  rhetoric regarding  “Made  in  China  2025”  in  response  to  concerns  from  advanced  industrial  countries  regarding the PRC’s  licit and  illicit acquisition of  intellectual property pursuant to that policy. ... China  already  has  a  2,000  km  secure  quantum communication  g round  line  between  Beijing  and  Shanghai  and  plans  to  expand  the  line  across China. Also  in  2019, a  separate  group of  scientists  claimed  to  have  developed  a brain computer  interface  that  enabled  human control  of  a  rat  in  a  maze,  signifying  China’s  interest  advanced  human-- thought machine  teaming technologies. In  2017,  China  designated  Alibaba,  Baidu,  iFlytek,  and  Tencent  as  the  country’s  official  “AI Champions,”  with  SenseTime  joining  in  2018. In  2019,  China  added  ten  new  companies,  including  Huawei,  Hikvision, Megvii,  and Yitu, to the  champions  list. Researchers  at  the  China  Academy  of  Sciences  reportedly  developed  an  early  version  of  an  AI powered  decision support  system  that  the  PRC  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  is  field-- testing  with  its diplomats.  The  system  uses  deep  learning  and  a  neural  network  for  “geopolitical  environment simulation and prediction.” This  included  remotely  operated  side  scan  sonar  systems, hydrophones, robotic  boats, unmanned  underwater  vehicles, and unmanned  surface vehicles. ... China  actively  seeks  partnerships  with  private, government,  and  academic  research  labs  to  gain  exposure  to  cutting edge  technology  and researchers. The PRC’s laws and its Military Civil-Fusion Development Strategy, however, means that civil-end use exports can be diverted without the exporter’s knowledge. (DOD, Force Modernization, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(September 1, 2020) The  Party’s  leaders  have increasingly  pushed  the  PLA  to  think  about  how  it  will  operate  beyond  China’s  borders  and  its immediate periphery to advance  and defend these interests. For  example,  seniorlevel  military visits  and exchanges  provide  the  PLA  with  opportunities  to  increase  its  officers’  international  exposure,  advance the  PRC’s  foreign  policy  goals  through  military  assistance  programs,  and  develop  professional relationships. PAP forces operating in Tajikistan are from Xinjiang province, likely also exporting its more suppressive approach to the “three evils.” ... Regardless,  a  global  PLA  military  logistics  network could  both  interfere  with  U.S.  military  operations  and  support  offensive  operations  against  the  United States  as  the  PRC’s  global  military  objectives  evolve. PLA  personnel  at  the  facility  have interfered  with  U.S.  flights  by  lasing  pilots  and  flying  drones,  and  the  PRC  has  sought  to  restrict Djiboutian sovereign airspace  over the base. ... China views the cyberspace domain as a platform providing opportunities for influence operations, and the PLA likely seeks to use online influence activities to support its overall “Three Warfares” concept and to undermine an adversary’s resolve in a contingency or conflict. The PRC’s influence operations are coordinated at a high level within the party-state and executed by a range of actors, such as the United Front Work Department, the Propaganda Ministry, the State Council Information Office, the PLA and the Ministry of State Security (MSS). A cornerstone  of  the  CCP’s  approach  to  influence  operations  includes  appealing  to  PRC  citizens  living overseas  and  members  of  Chinese  diaspora  populations,  regardless  of  their  citizenship,  to  advance  the Party’s  objectives.  The  PRC  also  sometimes  uses  coercion or  blackmail  to  manipulate  its  citizens overseas  to  conduct  influence  operations  on  behalf  of  the  PRC. They also  organize  protests  and  lodge  complaints  against  academic institutions  that fail to comport with the Party’s  narratives. This approach  allows  China  to  offer  expedited,  small exchange  for  seemingly  symbolic  gestures  of  support  to  the  PRC’s  longterm  strategic  goals. ... Russian  regulations  governing  the  passage  along  the  Northern  Sea  Route  requires  foreign  states' warships  to  give  Russia  45  days’  notice  of  their  intent ion  to  follow  this  route,  to  have  a  Russian  pilot on  board,  and  to  be  subject  to  Moscow’s  decision  to  refuse  passage  through  the  Northern  Sea  Route. This  regulation  potentially  restricts  the  PLAN’s  ability  to  operate  in  the  Arctic. In  2019, China  imported  approximately  10.1  million  barrels  per  day  of  crude  oil,  which  m et  approximately  77 percent  of  its  needs.  Also  in  2019,  China  met  43  percent  of  its  natural  gas  demand  with  imports,  which the  IEA  projects  will  grow  to  46  percent  by  2035. (DOD, China’s Global Military Activities, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(September 1, 2020) China  could  use  a  variety  of  disruptive,  punitive,  or  lethal military  actions  in  a  limited  campaign  against  Taiwan,  probably  in  conjunction  with  overt  and clandesti ne  economic  and  political  activities  supported  by  a  variety  of  IO  to  shape  perceptions  or undercut  the  effectiveness  or  legitimacy  of  the  Taiwan  authorities.  Such  a  campaign  could  include computer  network  or  limited  kinetic  attacks  against  Taiwan’s  politic al,  military,  and  economic infrastructure  to  induce  fear  in  Taiwan  and  degrade  the  Taiwan  population’s  confidence  in  their  leaders. The SSF 311 Base would also be responsible for political and psychological warfare against Taiwan to influence public opinion and promote the PRC’s interests. The PLA continues to make modest gains in amphibious warfare by developing additional capabilities to conduct amphibious landings and seize and defend small islands. In  August  2019,  Taiwan  said  it  would  increase  the  island’s  defense  budget  by  5.2  percent  to NT $358  billion  ($11.6  billion).  Meanwhile,  China’s  official  defense  budget  continues  to  grow,  and  for 2019,  is  roughly  15  times  that of  Taiwan.

(December 21, 2020) Malaysia will enter 2021 with its biggest spending plan yet to spur its virus-hit economy, but concerns are focusing on how to foot the bill after a sovereign-rating downgrade earlier this month. The government expects revenue to rise 4.2 per cent next year, counting on higher tax collections - without raising taxes or introducing new ones - coupled with a move to slash its dependence on oil. The plan hinges on one key assumption: that tax income will rise as economic activity returns close to normal.

(December 21, 2020) In the province of Guangdong, several cities, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou, whole streets remained in the dark as outdoor lights were also turned off amid the power cut. Some reported that the supply of water was also affected since midnight. In Yiwu of Zhejiang province, outdoor lights including street lamps and shop signs were all turned off in recent days. Cars must switch on their headlights to make their way through the pitch black at night. Some residents worry that the policy, which will last till the end of the year, will affect safety and encourage crime. (Nationwide power outages continue to worsen in China — Apple Daily) <br>

(December 20, 2020) US lawmakers have reached a deal to finalize a $900-billion (€735-billion) economic relief package that would deliver long-overdue help to businesses and individuals hit by the pandemic, top congressional leaders said Sunday. The package is the second-largest stimulus bill in US history, following the $2.2 trillion in aid that was passed under the CARES Act in March. Both chambers of Congress passed a stopgap measure on Sunday evening to extend federal funding by 24 hours to avoid a government shutdown, giving lawmakers more time to pass the relief bill. This would be followed by a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate later in the day [Monday]. (US Congress reaches deal on $900 billion COVID-19 relief package — DW News) <br>

(December 20, 2020) The United States is adding four entities to the Entity List for enabling human rights abuses within China by providing DNA-testing materials or high-technology surveillance equipment to the PRC government. Additionally, the Department of Commerce is adding nineteen entities to the Entity List for systematically coordinating and committing more than a dozen instances of theft of trade secrets from U.S. corporations to advance the PRC defense industrial complex; engaging in activities that undermine U.S. efforts to counter illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials. The Department of Commerce is adding 25 shipbuilding research institutes affiliated with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation to the Entity List, as well as six other entities that provide research, development, and manufacturing support for the People’s Liberation Army Navy or attempted to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of PLA programs.

Since  early  2018,  PRC occupied  Spratly Island  outposts  have  been  equipped  with  advanced  anti aircraft  missile  systems  and military  jamming  equipment,  marking  the  most  capable  landbased  weapons  systems  deployed  by  any claimant  in  the  disputed  South  China  Sea  to  date. ... In  August  2019,  China  submitted  “early  harvest”  proposals regarding  ChinaIndia  border  issues to  India,  which  was  the  first  time  that  China  had  approached  India  with  resolution  proposals. ... China  largely continues  to  enforce  a  number  of  the  UN  Security  Council’s  resolution  sanctions  against  North  Korea. China’s  focus  on  maintaining stability  on  the  Korean  Peninsula  involves  preventing  North  Korea’s  collapse  and  military  conflict  on the  Peninsula. (DOD, China’s Periphery, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(September 1, 2020) China’s lack of transparency regarding the scope and scale of its nuclear modernization program, however, raises questions regarding its future intent as it fields larger, more capable nuclear forces. China’s nuclear arsenal currently consists of approximately 100 ICBMs, including the silo-based CSS-4 Mod 2 (DF-5A) and Mod 3 (DF-5B); the solid-fueled, road-mobile CSS-10-class (DF-31, DF-31A and DF-31AG). China’s Jin SSBNs, which are equipped to carry up to 12 CSS-N-14 (JL-2) SLBMs, are the country’s first viable sea-based nuclear deterrent. The PLAAF publicly revealed the H-6N as a long-range strategic bomber during the 70th anniversary parade in October 2019. China probably has enough nuclear materials to at least double its warhead stockpile without new fissile material production. China maintained a high level of activity at its Lop Nur nuclear weapons test site throughout 2019, according to the U.S. Department of State. China  already  has  several  ground similar in appearance to U.S . PAVE  PAWS radars –- based  large  phase  array  radars that could support a missile  early  warning role. (These  images  show  that  new  silos,  having  first  been  identified  in  fall  2019  by  a  non organization’s  commercial  imagery, appear externally complete.) The PLA continues to maintain a robust and technologically advanced underground facility (UGF) program to protect all aspects of its military forces, including C2, logistics, missile systems, and naval forces. China has thousands of UGFs and it continues to construct more each year. China’s NFU policy also contributed to the construction of UGFs for the country’s nuclear forces, which may have planned to survive an initial nuclear first strike by an adversary. (DOD, Nuclear Deterrence, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(September 1, 2020) China  is  fielding  the  Integrated  Command  Platform  to  units  at  multiple  levels  across  the  force  to enable  lateral  and  crossservice  communications  required  for  joint  operations. As  the  PLA  continues  to  focus  on  its  ability  to  fight  and  win  informatized  wars,  future  information systems  will  likely  implement  emerging  technologies  such  as  big  data,  the  internet  of  things,  artificial intelligence  (AI),  and  cloud  computing  to  provide  reliable,  automated  platforms  yielding  further process  efficiencies. Potential  EW  targets  include  adversary  systems  operating  in  radio,  radar,  microwave,  infrared  and optical  frequency  ranges,  as  well  as  adversary  computer  and  information  systems. The PRC presents a significant, persistent cyber espionage and attack threat to military and critical infrastructure systems. China is improving its cyberattack capabilities and has the ability to launch cyberattacks—such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks—in the United States. Accordingly, the PLA probably seeks to use its cyberwarfare capabilities to collect data for intelligence and cyberattack purposes; to constrain an adversary’s actions by targeting network-based logistics, C2, communications, commercial activities, and civilian and defense critical infrastructure; or, to serve as a force-multiplier when coupled with kinetic attacks during armed conflict. PRC-based intrusions continued to target computer systems around the world including those owned by the U.S. Government through 2019. The targeted information can benefit China’s defense high-technology industries, support China’s military modernization, provide the CCP insights into U.S. leadership perspectives, and enable diplomatic negotiations, such as those supporting the One Belt, One Road initiative (OBOR). (DOD, Informatized Military, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(September 1, 2020) The PLAN’s force structure continues to evolve, incorporating more platforms with the versatility for both offshore and long- distance power projection. China is engaged in series production of the Renhai class CG, the Luyang III MOD class DDG, and the Jiangdao class FFL, with the full production run of Jiangkai II FFGs probably completed with the delivery of the 30th unit in the class. The Renhai CG displaces more than 10,000 tons and can carry an array of long-range ASCMs and SAMs. China continues to learn lessons from operating its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning. The PLAN’s ability to perform missions beyond the First Island Chain is modest but growing as it gains more experience operating in distant waters and acquires larger and more advanced platforms. However, in recent years, the PLA has begun conducting the very same types of military activities inside and outside the First Island Chain in the maritime zones of other countries. This activity highlights China’s double standard in the application of international law.

(December 20, 2020) Two main objectives of the Chinese government’s effort appeared to be making the virus impact seem less severe and making government officials appear to have a firmer grip on controlling the outbreak than they actually did, the report said. The censors also hired internet trolls to post "distracting chatter" on the internet to help influence public opinion as the coronavirus gradually became a bigger news story. The Chinese government also ordered security personnel to silence commentators whose views were not aligned with those of the government, according to the report. The U.S. president and others have claimed that bogus information from China had an adverse impact on other nations being able to prepare for the spread of the virus inside their borders.

(December 19, 2020) Is the wall, replete with high-voltage fences, surveillance cameras and infrared sensors, to contain the spread of Covid-19, which is running rampant in Myanmar after an initial period of denial of having any infections? Or is it, as the US-based broadcasting station Radio Free Asia reported in mid-December, to prevent Chinese dissidents from fleeing the country? Or is it mere muscle-flexing against a weaker neighbor, as Lower House lawmaker Sai Tun Aye suggested in an interview with the Myanmar website The Irrawaddy on November 26: “Our country is weak on all sides. We always experience some kind of bullying [from China].” It is much more likely that China wants to control the possible flow of “anti-state activities” — as any challenge to the supremacy of the ruling Communist Party is usually called — in the other direction.

(December 18, 2020) India is understood to be joining efforts by the US and Japan to design and build 5G networks without China’s involvement. Reports suggest the US, after putting restrictions on these companies at home, has been urging other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing allies, namely the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to do the same. The new security directive comes as the government announces plans to auction spectrum for commercial mobile services. The auction will be for spectrum in various frequency bands between 700 MHz and 2,500 MHz. Over the next six months, the government will declare a list of so-called “trusted sources” and “trusted products.” Some analysts suggest the government could be using the announcement to leverage its bargaining position with China. In February, India put restrictions on China investing in local banks without prior approval. After the Ladakh incursions, India shut out Chinese infrastructure companies from local projects. In June, citing security concerns, India initially banned 59 Chinese apps, including the hugely popular Bytedance’s Tik-Tok and Alibaba’s UC Browser, and followed up with bans on another 47 apps in July. India banned another 118 in September, including PUBG, and 43 more in November.  (India building defenses against Huawei 5G — Asia Times) <br>

(September 1, 2020) These capabilities span the air, maritime, space, electromagnetic, and information domains. Additionally, the PLA has fielded CSS-5 ASBMs specifically designed to hold adversary aircraft carriers at risk when located up to 1,500 km off China’s coast, and it has an ASBM variant of the longer range DF-26 IRBM. China’s investment in advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems, counterspace capabilities, and cyber operations – combined with more traditional forms of information control, such as propaganda and denial via opacity – reflect the priority the PLA places on information advantage. China also continues to develop counterspace capabilities and related technologies, including kinetic-kill missiles, ground-based lasers, and orbiting space robots, as well as expanding space surveillance capabilities, which can monitor objects across the globe and in space and enable counterspace actions. Chinese cyber attack operations aim to target critical military and civilian nodes to deter or disrupt adversary intervention, and to retain the option to scale these attacks to achieve desired conditions with minimal strategic cost. The HQ-19 interceptor has undergone tests to verify its capability against 3,000 km-range ballistic missiles. In addition, China is pursuing a mid-course interceptor that may have capabilities against IRBMs and possibly ICBMs. The PLAN is currently fielding the H-6J bomber, a maritime derivative of the H-6K, which can carry up to six supersonic YJ-12 ASCMs each, allowing for saturation attacks against U.S. naval groups within the Second Island Chain. China continues to build a multi-carrier force. (DOD, PLA Capabilities in Development, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(September 1, 2020) As part of its efforts to restructure the PLA for modern warfare, the CMC established the PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2016 as a theater command-level organization to centralize the PLA’s strategic space, cyber, electronic, and psychological warfare missions and capabilities. The SSF’s creation highlights the PRC’s understanding of information as a strategic resource in modern warfare. Among the impetuses for the SSF’s establishment was the PLA's apparent concern about the disparity between its cyber capabilities and those of the United States and the view of China’s leaders that achieving information dominance and denying adversaries the use of the electromagnetic spectrum is necessary to seize and maintain the strategic initiative in a conflict. The  SFF  may  be  the  PRC’s first  step  in  the  development  of  a  cyber  force  by  centralizing  the  PLA’s  previously  disparate  cyber reconnaissance, cyberattack, and cyber defense capabilities  and units  into one organization.

(December 18, 2020) The United States and Australia have both sent military vessels through the South China Sea, which Beijing effectively began annexing at the start of the decade. China initially insisted that it would not deploy military units to the islands, but large-scale reclamation work has been undertaken on a number of the larger islands, with missile emplacements and runways constructed for fighter aircraft. Akitoshi Miyashita, a professor of international relations at Tokyo International University, says Japan's invitation to Germany is part of a bigger campaign to build an alliance against further Chinese territorial ambitions. Tokyo has already announced that Japan, France and the US will carry out joint military maneuvers for the first time in May 2021, while the British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will also travel to the region with an accompanying task force for exercises.

Wang Mang 王莽 (45 BCE-23 CE) was a high minister and nephew of Empress Dowager Wang 王太后 (Wang Zhengjun 王政君, 71 BCE-13 CE) of the late Former Han period 漢 (206 BCE-8 AD). He managed to control the succession to the throne and in 8 CE usurped the throne, proclaiming his own Xin dynasty 新 (8-23 CE). After unsuccessful attempts at reform he met resistance by large parts of the officialdom and the population and was killed in the course of a vast rebellion. Wang Mang attempted to follow the example of the ancient Zhou dynasty 周 (11th cent.-221 BCE) and revived the administrative system described in the Classic Zhouli 周禮. By these measures he met the serious resistance of the magnates that did not want to have their land confiscated by the state to see it redistributed to the landless tenant farmers. Another reform project of Wang Mang was the state monopoly on the production and merchandise on salt, iron, ferments, coins and ores (wujun liuguan 五均六筦 "the five [markets] to be [controlled] justly and the six [goods] to be controlled").

(December 17, 2020) The US government confirmed Wednesday that a massive hack had occurred in at least two federal departments, including the US Treasury and the Department of Commerce. "This is a developing situation, and while we continue to work to understand the full extent of this campaign, we know this compromise has affected networks within the federal government," said a joint statement from the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Hackers were able to monitor internal email traffic at the Treasury and Department of Commerce. Hackers were able to access federal agencies through holes in software from US-based company SolarWinds. The company offered updates to its Orion software in March that unknowingly included hidden malicious code that could give hackers the same views as in-house IT crews. Also on that Monday, SolarWinds' two largest investors, which control a majority stake in the company, sold more than $280 million in stock to a Canadian public pension fund.

(December 17, 2020) The University of Michigan researchers write, “To guard against shipping chips with errors (intentional or otherwise) chip design companies rely on post-fabrication testing. Unfortunately, this type of testing leaves the door open to malicious  modifications since attackers can craft attack triggers requiring a sequence of unlikely events, which will never be encountered by even the most diligent tester.” If back doors in sophisticated chips are undetectable, US officials argue, the independent verification that Huawei proposes can’t be trusted. China’s national security law obliges Huawei to provide data when the Chinese authorities demand it. ... Banning Huawei equipment won’t make networks secure, because bad actors can infiltrate tainted chips into other equipment as well. Germany’s largest mobile network provider Deutsche Telekom relies on Huawei for about two-thirds of its existing 4G network equipment.

(December 16, 2020) Acting on a tip from Japanese cyber researchers, the African Union’s (AU) technology staffers discovered that a group of suspected Chinese hackers had rigged a cluster of servers in the basement of an administrative annex to quietly siphon surveillance videos from across the AU’s sprawling campus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. Longstanding doubts over Beijing's role at the AU spilled into the open in 2018, when French newspaper Le Monde reported here that AU employees had found that the servers at the new conference center were sending copies of their contents to Shanghai every night and that the building itself had been honeycombed with listening devices. The memo said the hackers were able to siphon off “a huge volume of traffic” from the servers by hiding it in the regular flow of data leaving the AU’s network during business hours, even pausing their data theft during lunch.

Offering  no introspection  on  Beijing’s  own  role  in  stirring  geopolitical  tensions  through  its  economic  practices, military activities and modernization, excessive  maritime territorial claims, or efforts  to  revise aspects of  global  governance,  the  PRC  describes  the  international  system  as  being  “…undermined  by  growing hegemonism,  power  politics,  unilateralism  and  constant  regional  conflicts  and  wars. ...

For  countries  with  whom  China has  not  established  strategic  partnerships,  such  as  the  United  State, China  shapes  its  military cooperation  along  more  minimalist principles of conflict  avoidance  that  emphasize  “nonconflict”  and “mutual  respect.” (DOD, China’s Foreign Policy, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China) <br>

(December 15, 2020) At the eastern port city of Suao, Tsai launched the first mass production ship of the Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes, which has been dubbed “aircraft carrier killers” by Taiwan’s navy due to its anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles. The Tuo Chiang-class corvette has a maximum speed of 30 knots, a maximum operational range of more than 1,800 miles, and a displacement of about 700 tons, according to Taiwan’s navy.

(December 15, 2020) Sky News host Paul Murray says Australians know we have done nothing wrong to provoke China, apart from simply wanting more information about a pandemic which has killed 1.5 million people around the world. Mr Murray pointed to multiple left-leaning opinion polls which reveal the majority of people believe the prime minister was right to demand an apology from China and that Australia is the innocent victim of Chinese assertion.

(September 13, 2020) The title of the show implied that it was going to highlight the major contributions women had made in China's epidemic fight. Women account for the majority of China's front-line workers. However, the show's pilot, released with much fanfare and publicity, was panned on China's IMDB-like website, Douban. Film critics noted that it scored an embarrassing 2.4 out of 10, and it received many critical comments, mainly about its depiction of women, before they were suddenly suspended on the site. Some Weibo users have quoted the famous Mao Zedong quote: that "women hold up half the sky", and thousands of comments are to be found, criticising the perception the show has of women playing an "inferior" role. One Weibo user says that the drama's omission of Dr Li Wenliang and Dr Ai Fen meant it was "not worth watching" because the government does "not have the courage to face the full picture of history".

(September 1, 2020) For  example,  Beijing views  U.S.  security  alliances  and partnerships,  especially  those  in  the  IndoPacific  region,  as destabilizing  and  irreconcilable  with  the  PRC’s  sovereignty,  security,  and  development  interests. In  practice,  the  PRC  often  favors “dialogue”  as  a  power  play  and  a  means  of  using  political,  economic,  or  military  coercion  rather  than force. Beijing  has  also  expressed  concerns  over  growing  global  instability  and  a  mounting  sense  of  insecurity towards  the  United  States. China  seeks  to  secure  and  advance  its  overseas  interests  without  entirely  compromising  the relationships  and  stability crucial  to  its  continued  development — China’s  highest  priority  at  this  stage of  its  strategy.

(September 10, 2019) This tactic of incrementally advancing interests and challenging existing dominances and norms, resulting in increased pressure and geopolitical tensions, has taken place across many domains. From the economic to military and political, salami-slicing tactics and cabbage strategies have become core components of the Chinese military and security diet, and with laudable success. Given China’s prior actions and embrace of new technologies, cyber salami would make for a logical dish in its foreign policy and security cuisine. A Chinese cyber salami-slicing campaign could exist as an escalatory cyber campaign. Starting with simple disruptive actions such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, it could, slowly and gradually, see an escalation of forays into the digital realm – in quality, quantity, and aims. From DDoS aggressions it could seek to apply pressure to an opposing state via cyber political warfare, along the lines of the infamous “fake news” campaign, seeking to change the information narrative, interfering in elections and other political processes. Ultimately, such a campaign could result, as the final step of an escalatory cyber ladder, in destructive attacks against targets in the physical domain. Accordingly, the campaign might operate with an impact scale that ranges from disruptive attacks, based on a short time frame and scale, to strikes against critical infrastructure, with national-level consequences in both the short and long-term. A fundamental component of any successful cyber salami-slicing move by China would be to ensure that the costs of the combined tactics and thus overall strategy are below the costs of retaliation. The experiences with salami-slicing in the physical domain have illustrated that once deployed effectively, few opportunities exist to reverse the situation. Rather, it leads to a gradual calibration of the status quo. As such, it seems imperative for regional actors to start thinking of how to effectively engage with the digital variant of this Chinese foreign policy dish.

At the end of November much had been written and was ready; I burned it all; I can confess that now. I didn't like it myself. A new form, a new plan excited me, and I started all over again. (Dostoevsky's letter to his friend Alexander Wrangel in February 1866, Crime and Punishment) <br>

(December 14, 2020) Canada has shown no interest in negotiation, survivor says. Edmund Metatawabin, former chief of Fort Albany First Nation, is one of several survivors pushing for the federal government to release documents they say would corroborate their claims of abuse. Independent Sen. Murray Sinclair, who chaired the Truth and Reconciliation, told host Chris Hall on CBC Radio's The House that the Liberal government's legal battle with St. Anne's residential school survivors diminishes Indigenous rights, and is an example of the federal government not living up to its promises around reconciliation. If the records were not disclosed and eventually destroyed, Sinclair said, the government would be "participating in the destruction of our national memory."

(December 14, 2020) Lam, who was among the five booksellers abducted by and detained in China in 2015 for selling materials critical of Beijing’s political elite, moved to Taipei in April last year, where he set up a new bookshop this year. If Hong Kong people in exile pose a threat to the regime, it may consider restricting exit just as mainland Chinese authorities tightly control its borders and limit citizens’ rights to leave the country, he added. “On the one hand, the Taiwanese government said they are helping Hong Kong people, on the other, they are applying stricter thresholds.” The Overseas Chinese and Foreign Investment Commission said the new policy is to block people who are not sincere about investing in Taiwan.

(December 14, 2020) Taiwan may have a better chance of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) than mainland China, given the requirements for entering the Pacific Rim deal, according to analysts and Taiwanese officials. The Taipei government has been holding informal dialogue with the 11 members of the CPTPP, a revamped version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership formed after the United States’ 2017 withdrawal.

(December 14, 2020) The Sudanese authorities had been trying to get off the list for many years. The US would never have removed Sudan from the list as long as Bashir was in power; this has been made possible as a civilian cabinet is now in place. This is a major win for civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and his government. The country was cut off from the global financial system.

(December 13, 2020) As of January 2020, China had signed about 200 agreements with 138 countries in these regions as well as with 30 international bodies under the initiative. Between 2015 and this October, China secured infrastructure projects worth more than US$736.1 billion along the Belt and Road countries, according to China’s commerce ministry. The mainland’s direct investment in non-financial projects in these countries also totaled US$88.5 billion, the ministry’s figures showed. Since 2013, loans issued by Chinese financial institutions under the Belt and Road Initiative amounted to US$461 billion, according to Washington-based consultancy RWR Advisory Group. But not all of these projects have borne fruit. A total of 236 projects in 66 countries had been aborted due to opposition from local residents or concerns over their national security and China’s labor policies, RWR said in a 2018 report. The number of large-scale Belt and Road projects in Southeast Asia fell to only 12 in the second half of 2018 after some were halted in Malaysia, Pakistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to the American Enterprise Institute think tank.

(Oct. 23, 1986) Marshal Ye Jianying, a veteran Communist army officer who became one of China's leaders in the late 1970's and the head of state from 1978 to 1983, died yesterday, the New China News Agency reported in Peking. At the peak of his career in 1976 and 1977, when he was the party's deputy chairman, analysts said Marshal Ye's eminence and power had other sources: He was the leading figure in the Military Affairs Commission, the party body overseeing the army, when the army was playing an influential part in political events. He was also the chief political commissar for Guangdong. After Lin Biao, the Defense Minister, died in a purported coup attempt in September 1971, Marshal Ye took his place. The marshal had come to be regarded as an obstacle to Mr. Deng's campaign to root out Maoist influences, which were diminished in late 1982 and early 1983 by the removal of various officers from national and provincial positions. A son, Jianmin, was appointed Governor of Guangdong Province in 1985. (Marshal Ye Jianying dies at 90; had been China's head of state — NY Times) <br>

This would be the largest limitation to innovation.” (‘Leaders can’t be self-centered,’ billionaire Li Ka-shing says — Apple Daily) <br>

(December 10, 2020) The European Commission also proposed that Britain and the EU continue to offer reciprocal access to their fishing waters for up to a year, but London quickly rebuffed the idea. Basic connections by road freight and for road passengers would also continue for six months as long as it was reciprocal. Failure to agree new rules to govern everything from car parts to Camembert would snarl borders, shock financial markets and sow chaos through supply chains in a world already grappling with the economic cost of COVID-19. Johnson portrays Brexit as a chance to give Britain a fully independent, more agile economy. EU powers fear London wants the best of both worlds - preferential access to EU markets but with the advantage to set its own rules. That, they say, would undermine the post-World War Two project that sought to bind the ruined nations of Europe - and particularly Germany and France - into a global trading power. The EU wants Britain to remain tied to the bloc’s labour, social and environmental standards in the future, as well as to state aid rules for corporate state subsidies.

(December 10, 2020) Taiwan commissioned the first of a new fleet of coastguard ships on Friday, an advanced catamaran that can be armed with missiles during war, as the island bolsters its defences in the face of what it sees as a growing threat from Beijing. With Taiwan’s armed forces dwarfed by China’s, Tsai has championed the concept of “asymmetric warfare”, including adding weapons that are mobile and harder to attack, to make any Chinese offensive costly and difficult. While the United States remains Taiwan’s most important arms supplier, Tsai has also boosted the island’s indigenous defence industry, most notably the planned building of eight submarines. Taiwan’s coastguard is often involved in confrontations with Chinese fishing and sand-dredging ships which Taiwan says operate illegally in its waters.

(December 9, 2020) The European Union and the United States should work together to stand up to coercive Chinese diplomacy and coordinate with other countries in the region on the disputed South China Sea, the EU ambassador to China said on Thursday. China claims almost the entire South China Sea and warns other countries not to interfere in its dealings with Southeast Asian countries that also claim parts of the waterway and worry about China’s increasingly militarised presence there.

(December 9, 2020) The United States on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Wan Kuok Kai, the leader of China’s 14K Triad organized crime group and a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the U.S. Treasury said. The sanctions also apply to three entities headed by Wan, who is also known as “Broken Tooth,” the agency said in a statement. The Treasury also designated three entities owned or controlled by Wan: Cambodia-based World Hongmen History and Culture Association; Hong Kong-based Dongmei Group; and the Palau China Hung-Mun Cultural Association, based in Palau. It said the World Hongmen group had co-opted elites in Malaysia and Cambodia, continuing a “pattern of overseas Chinese actors trying to paper over illegal criminal activities by framing their actions in terms of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)” and other major initiatives of the CCP.

(December 9, 2020) Fang Fang, a k a Christine Fang, got close to several politicians, especially in the Bay Area, from 2011 to 2015, only to abruptly leave the country as the FBI was closing in. US officials believe China’s Ministry of State Security, its main civilian spy agency, sent her here to collect intelligence and gain influence with up-and-coming politicians. Axios reports Fang had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors; Swalwell won’t say whether he slept with the honeytrap. But then the FBI, in the midst of a counterintelligence probe into Fang’s activities, briefed him in 2015, and he cut all ties. ... Indeed, he’s angrier about the leak than he is about China targeting him. (Eric Swalwell, a Chinese ‘honeytrap’ and FBI double standards — New York Post) <br>

(December 9, 2020) Health Canada announced the approval Wednesday after scientists finished a two-month review of the company's clinical trial data.

(December 9, 2020) Honda said it was forced to halt production because "transport-related" delays meant a lack of parts. Tim Morris, chief executive of UK Major Ports Group said the pandemic has created an "unprecedented volatility in global supply chains." Honda's Swindon plant, which manufactures the Civic compact family car, is set to close permanently in July of next year. The company cited global changes in the car industry and the need to launch electric vehicles as the main reasons for the closure.

(December 9, 2020) US President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter has said his tax affairs are under investigation. Hunter said he learned of the investigation on Tuesday.

(December 9, 2020) A case filed directly in the Supreme Court this week by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton contending that state officials in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin unconstitutionally expanded mail-in voting has been hailed as game-changer by the president, who tweeted on Wednesday that it was “the big one” that “everyone has been waiting for.” The Supreme Court so far has shown little interest in getting involved.

(October 29, 2020) Shared on Facebook and Instagram days leading up to the 2020 U.S. general election, posts show a clip of Joe Biden saying, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.” Biden’s campaign for months has been ramping up what it calls the largest voter protection program in presidential election history, after Trump repeatedly has suggested without evidence that the election could be “rigged”. Paid for by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the voter hotline Biden mentions is “monitored by DNC employees 24/7/365 who are ready to field questions pertaining to felon disenfranchisement, voter purging, poll worker misconduct, voter machines, accessibility, and more”. (Fact check: Clip of Biden taken out of context to portray him as plotting a voter fraud scheme — Reuters) <br>

(March 19, 2020) “If people would have known about it, it could have been stopped in place,” Trump said. “It could have been stopped right where it came from, China, if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it. But now the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible virus.” China’s top disciplinary body on Thursday blamed Wuhan police for inappropriately reprimanding whistle-blowing doctor Li Wenliang, whose warnings about the virus made him a folk hero. The findings stopped short of recommending disciplinary action against top Wuhan officials as many residents had demanded on social media. At the same, state media have highlighted struggles to contain the disease in the West and Chinese diplomats have lashed out at foreign officials who attempt to blame Beijing for the outbreak. The embassy also shared a tweet, later deleted, calling the Bolsonaro family “poison” for Brazil, which prompted an angry reaction from Brazil Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo. In a statement, Araujo demanded an apology from China. (Trump Says China Could’ve ‘Stopped’ Virus Now Roiling U.S. — Bloomberg) <br>

(December 9, 2020) Ethnic Uighurs in China's Xinjiang were "arbitrarily" selected for arrest by a computer program that flagged suspicious behavior, Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote in a report detailing an expansive data collection project. The people were flagged using the IJOP program before officials decided whether to send them to camps, according to HRW. The list suggests that the "vast majority" of people were flagged to authorities for legal behavior, including phone calls to relatives abroad, having no fixed address, switching off their phone repeatedly, or appearing "generally untrustworthy." Beijing said that the heavily guarded centers are educational and vocational institutes and that all who have attended have "graduated" and gone home. Surveillance spending in Xinjiang has surged in recent years, with facial recognition, iris scanners, DNA collection and artificial intelligence put to use across the province.

(December 9, 2020) Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith says he “really hopes” Victoria’s Belt and Road agreement will be vetoed amid the passing of the foreign relations bill, because the state becoming a “death-slave” to China is not in Australia’s national interest in any way. The foreign relations bill – passed on Tuesday - gives the Commonwealth power to block any agreement between Australian states, councils or institutions, and a foreign government. “If state governments want to enter into these sorts of weird and wonderful agreements then they’ve got to check it off with Canberra first.” (Victoria becoming a ‘death slave’ to China not ‘in any way’ in the national interest — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(December 8, 2020) The state of Texas, aiming to help President Donald Trump upend the results of the US election, said on Tuesday it has sued Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin at the Supreme Court, calling changes those states made to election procedures amid the coronavirus pandemic unlawful. The long-shot lawsuit, announced by the Republican attorney general of Texas Ken Paxton, was being filed directly with the Supreme Court rather than with a lower court, as is permitted for certain litigation between states. Texas makes the remarkable request of the Supreme Court to immediately block the four states from using the voting results to appoint presidential electors to the Electoral College.

(December 8, 2020) US cybersecurity firm FireEye says it has recently been attacked by a "highly sophisticated threat actor", believing the hacking was state-sponsored. "The attacker primarily sought information related to certain government customers," he wrote. "Based on my 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, I've concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities," Mr Mandia said in Saturday's blog, adding that the hack was "different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years". FireEye says its hacking tool chest has been plundered meaning that whoever it was now has a potent collection of new techniques to draw upon. The race is on to get the warnings out there before the hackers take advantage. (US cybersecurity firm FireEye hit by 'state-sponsored' attack — BBC) <br>

(December 8, 2020) Shipments of Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine Coronavac have arrived in Indonesia in preparation for a mass vaccination campaign, with another 1.8m doses due to arrive by January. On paper, one of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the Oxford vaccine, which is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at -20C and Pfizer's vaccine at -70C. The virus situation has for the most part been contained in China - and life is slowly but surely returning to a "new normal". (Sinovac: What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccine? — BBC) <br>

It won't be too many years before they match us, because they're stealing our technology. We have people that are facilitating that." In a recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Ratcliffe wrote, "China Is National Security Threat No. 1." "You should be very concerened, because China is not our friend," Biggs said.

(December 8, 2020) Footage from Tucker Carlson on Fox News showed a Chinese academic telling a room full of people the reason China and the US - between 1992 and 2016 - were able to settle all kinds of issues was because China has people at the “top of America’s core inner circle of power and influence”. “They’re doing all of this in the open, they’re mocking us in the open, they are using our own tactics against us like progressive politics, we are in a trade war with them, they are in grey zone warfare at the moment making moves against us,” Ms Southern said. “This is going to be a waiting game.

(December 8, 2020) Meanwhile, Beijing has built up the second-largest defense budget in the world. At the moment, NATO's own rhetoric can be best summed up in Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's statement that China "does not share our values, it undermines human rights, it bullies other countries and is increasingly engaging in a systemic competition with us." Nonetheless, Beijing is not seen as an adversary, much less a threat. Beijing will work hard, Fallon said, to prevent the growing cohesion by using the same techniques it has "successfully deployed" in the European Union, for example, to "pull countries into its orbit to prevent these organizations from speaking with one voice." "The Balkans are convenient" for China, she explained, "as we do not have harsh ecological and procurement regulations and have more 'flexible' rule of law." The region is important real estate for Beijing, Milic points out, as it connects the ports China already owns in Greece - to NATO's consternation - to the European Union. In addition, the U.S.'s accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999 continues to serve the interests of those wanting to stoke animosity to NATO.

(December 7, 2020) George Gascón embarked Monday on a plan to reimagine criminal prosecutions in Los Angeles County, announcing sweeping policy changes he’ll make as district attorney that include an end to cash bail, a ban on prosecutors seeking enhanced prison sentences and showing leniency to many low-level offenders. The moves echo steps taken by Gascón in San Francisco. Nearly 10% of all misdemeanor cases presented to Gascón during his time in office in the Bay Area were diverted into pretrial alternative sentencing programs. The strategy was routinely lambasted by police and some community leaders, however, with many blaming the lack of punishment as a driving force behind a historic surge in property crime and car break-ins seen during Gascón’s tenure there. Gascón acknowledged that the changes might seem enormous and asked doubters to trust him. (On first day as L.A. County D.A., George Gascón eliminates bail, remakes sentencing rules — LA Times) <br>

(December 3, 2020) The U.S. government estimates that China’s intellectual-property theft costs America as much as $500 billion a year, or between $4,000 and $6,000 per U.S. household. Huawei and other Chinese firms deny this, but China’s efforts to dominate 5G telecommunications will only increase Beijing’s opportunities to collect intelligence, disrupt communications and threaten user privacy world-wide. We shouldn’t assume that Beijing’s efforts to drag the world back into the dark will fail just because the forces of good have triumphed before in modern times. This generation will be judged by its response to China’s effort to reshape the world in its own image and replace America as the dominant superpower. The intelligence is clear. Our response must be as well. (China Is National Security Threat No. 1 — John Ratcliffe, Wall Street Journal) <br>

(October 21, 2020) China claims the small archipelago as the Xisha Islands, as well as sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where it has built numerous military installations on islands, reefs and shoals. But now, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is numerically the largest in the world, according to a recently released Pentagon report detailing the massive resources Beijing has poured into backing up its foreign policy ambitions with force. According to the report, the PLAN has a battle force of approximately 350 vessels, the majority of which are missile patrol boats, corvettes, frigates and destroyers distributed across northern, eastern and southern theaters along the coast of China. Many of these vessels are "multi-role platforms" equipped with advanced anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine weapons and sensors. The US Navy's battle force numbers approximately 293 ships as of early 2020. The Chinese navy approaches 2 million tons, while the US Navy tops 4.6 million tons, according to a 2019 estimate by the Center for International Maritime Security. And Chinese shipbuilders are working to quickly catch up with the US Navy on tonnage. The Pentagon points out that China is now the "top ship-producing nation in the world by tonnage." The US Navy operates larger vessels, like its 11 aircraft carriers, to project force around the world, and China doesn't necessarily need a blue-water navy right now to deter access to the South China Sea. When Beijing looks out into the Pacific, it sees itself encircled by the so-called first island chain, consisting of the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan and the Philippines. "The PLA is developing the capabilities and operational concepts to conduct offensive operations within the Second Island Chain, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in some cases, globally," it said. But for now, China's greatest naval strength remains close to home. And the Pentagon report indicates that Beijing's capabilities to carry out coordinated operations diminish with distance, with the PLAN's ability to execute missions beyond the first island chain remaining "modest but growing." "I think the conventional wisdom is that the United States will maintain a technological advantage for at least the next two decades," said Poling.

(October 8, 2020) Here, however, we use in-depth analyses of the available data and literature to prove that these novel animal coronaviruses do not exist in nature and their sequences have been fabricated. The fact that data fabrications were used to cover up the true origin of SARS-CoV-2 further implicates that the laboratory modification here is beyond simple gain-of-function research.

Amid Trump’s unpredictable moves, Biegun won admirers in South Korea, where one former senior diplomat said he clearly has experience in handling complex issues and knows how Washington works.

(December 7, 2020) Beijing’s action heightened alarm in the West. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group - comprised of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - said last month the move appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics, and called on China to reverse course. The sanctions prohibit the 14 individuals and their immediate members from traveling to the United States. Any assets the officials might have within the United States will be blocked and U.S. individuals and companies will be banned from dealing with them. The news kept global markets on edge as investors fretted over fresh Sino-U.S. tensions, which offset bets over more stimulus in Europe and the United States.

"He can do it with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 He can even maybe use the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917. But we've got to break those connections, because if we don't do that, we are going into a point where we may not be able to deter China," Chang warned, "because they are so arrogant, so belligerent that they think they can buy any American politician, including the president of the United States."

Xpeng, listed in New York since August, also surpassed Ford in value last month. The battle for supremacy in China’s new-energy vehicle market began in earnest after Tesla started domestic production of its bestselling Model 3 car in December 2019. In October, Tesla cut the starting price of the Model 3 by 8 per cent to 249,900 yuan, ratcheting up pressure on its Chinese rivals.

(December 7, 2020) Armed groups in Myanmar – including the United Wa State Army and the Arakan Army, which was designated a terrorist organisation this year – are acting as Beijing’s proxies by supplying weapons and providing hideouts to insurgent groups in India’s northeastern states, according to Indian officials with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because of rules for speaking with the media. China’s Foreign Ministry denied claims the country was supporting armed groups against India, saying it does not interfere in the affairs of other countries. The United Wa State Army also denied a role in providing any aid or support to Indian rebel groups on China’s behalf, citing, among other factors, the over 800km (500 miles) between their headquarters and the India-Myanmar border. Both India and China are investing in Myanmar for strategic reasons. Beijing is investing in gas pipelines and roads to link its southern province of Yunnan with the Bay of Bengal, allowing for key imports to bypass the Malacca Strait between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. India, meanwhile, is investing in the US$292 million Kaladan Multimodal project to connect its underdeveloped northeastern states to the Bay of Bengal.

Banks usually would not take the “serious” step of freezing accounts unless there was sufficient and solid evidence, the industry insider added. As a general rule, banks in Hong Kong are required to give 30 days’ notice before closing a client’s account.

In response to the decision, the TV station, owned by pro-China snack tycoon and Want Want China chair Tsai Eng-meng, said that it was angry and disappointed. The seven-member commission on Nov. 18 unanimously vetoed CTiTV’s license renewal application, saying that the station had run afoul of regulations multiple times and failed to live up to professional standards.

The report also contains a stark warning about the possibility of future incidents and the US government's ability to detect them or to mount a response. The fact that American government employees reported afflictions not only in Cuba and China but also in Russia and other countries raises questions about how widespread the incidents may be.

They paid a lot of money. They don’t like me. The happiest people in the world right now are the leaders of China, the second happiest or the leaders of Iran. What we would have done in the next four years, we would have been on a footing like nobody’s ever. And now we’re giving it all away. But China said, “We will not deal with you unless you get rid of the America First policy.” And you know what the Democrats said? They said, “Yes, we will do that.” Can you believe this? ... The left lies, they cheat and they steal. They are ruthless and they are hellbent on getting power and control by any means necessary. They investigate you and they prosecute you. The moment you question them, they try and intimidate you. They call you a poor American. “You’re not a good American. You don’t love our country.” They don’t love our country. They beat you down, shut you up and make you retreat. That’s what they do. That’s what they’ve done to your governor. They’ve done that to your governor. (Trump rally in Valdosta, GA) <br>

(December 6, 2020) Figures compiled from federal government websites, corporate financial reports, the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer and through access to information requests indicate that Ottawa made $240 billion in payments and transfers to individuals, businesses, organizations and government entities between the beginning of the lockdown on March 13 and Nov. 20. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's financial update on Nov. 30 pegged total government spending on the pandemic at $322.3 billion for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2021. The CBC News analysis has tracked $105.66 billion in federal payments to individuals; $118.37 billion that has gone to businesses, non-profits and charitable organizations; and a further $16.17 billion in transfers to government departments and agencies. The largest single expenditure thus far has been the $81.64 billion spent on the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB), the monthly $2,000 payments that were offered to Canadians who were unable to work during the pandemic, with 8.9 million people — a third of all adults in the country — having received them. But the federal subsidies for businesses and other organizations have been even larger. Those supports include $49.27 billion sent to more than 352,000 enterprises to help defray payroll costs under the Canada emergency wage subsidy (CEWS). Another $31.55 billion of interest-free loans extended to almost 790,000 businesses under the Canada emergency business account. At one point this past summer, Ottawa was providing money to 11,721,827 people via CERB and CEWS — meaning that almost 40 per cent of all Canadian adults were receiving government assistance. But in most cases, the federal government refuses to provide details that may serve to identify who has received these funds — even when it's a business. In some cases, the information has pointed to potential conflicts of interest. CBC News has also uncovered new details about the extent of government support for some publicly traded companies. According to the government's official figures, a total of 380 companies received more than $5 million each in CEWS assistance, while close to 3,500 businesses have received between $1 million and $5 million. Ottawa's PPE-related expenditures, largely made on behalf of the provinces and territories, have also been extensive. At least 35 of the contracted companies appear to be based outside of Canada, and have signed agreements worth a total of $607.7 million. ... "All companies who are applying for contracts and wage subsidies should have to declare who their ultimate, beneficial owners are," said Cohen. "Transparent disclosures so that the government sustains the trust of Canadians in the rollout of these needed funds." Page wonders if someone in government is actually trying to obscure the data, or whether it's just a byproduct of the pressures surrounding the COVID-19 fight. "I hope it's not deliberate," he said.

(December 5, 2020) Scientists hope the samples — possibly weighing just 0.1 grams — from the Ryugu asteroid will provide clues to the origin of life and the formation of the solar system. It is believed that the 4.6 billion-year-old material has remained unchanged since the system around the Earth's sun formed. The probe took more than a year to travel back from the asteroid, which was around 300 million kilometers away from Earth when Hayabusa2 carried out its debris collecting task. The 40-centimeter (16-inch) diameter capsule landed in the sparsely populated Woomera area of Australia. After depositing its samples, the Hayabusa2 probe took a new course to begin another journey, expected to take 10 years one way, to the small asteroid called 1998KY26.

(December 5, 2020) With over 80 million health profiles, China has the largest DNA database in the world, and growing. They have also found ways to obtain the DNA of foreigners, including Americans. For example, in 2015 it was discovered that the PRC hacked Anthem, the second-largest insurance company in the U.S. According to Chang, genetic data gives China the ability to create bioweapons that can target certain groups of people. Furthermore, he said the country’s behavior of collecting the DNA of foreigners while prohibiting Chinese DNA to foreign researchers supports this theory. In 1984 the PRC signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) treaty in 1984 which prohibits them from developing, producing or stockpiling biological or toxin weapons.

The data included information on components for Italian civilian and military aircraft. Prosecutors in the southern city of Naples said a former employee of the company in the cybersecurity division had infected 94 computers with malware from a USB stick at facilities in Pomigliano d'Arco near Naples and extracted "classified information of significant value to the company." Investigators uncovered unusual activity on several computers as a result of the malware program. The hackers had been able to use the program to intercept messages and capture images from other workers' screens. Some 48 of the compromised computers belonged to work stations involved in the aerospace sector. (Italian police arrest 2 in defense data theft case — DW News) <br>

(December 4, 2020) The executive order would allow the Commerce Department to prohibit U.S. cloud providers from partnering with foreign cloud companies that offer safe haven to hackers and give the Commerce secretary the ability to ban those foreign providers from operating in the U.S., four people told POLITICO. The draft order is designed to deter malicious foreign actors from using cloud service providers to quickly and anonymously conduct cyberattacks, according to three people familiar with the order. It would require U.S. cloud service companies, which typically process or host data for third parties, to keep a log of the identities of foreign customers as a matter of course, the people said.

(December 4, 2020) U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday he had imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and others who have used or threatened to use violence, the release of private information or other coercive tactics to intimidate critics. Pompeo said the visa restrictions would apply to those “who have engaged in the use or threat of physical violence, theft and release of private information, espionage, sabotage, or malicious interference in domestic political affairs, academic freedom, personal privacy, or business activity.” He accused China of seeking to “co-opt and coerce” people in the United States and elsewhere to support its “authoritarian narratives and policy preferences” and called on Beijing “to end its use of coercion and intimidation tactics to suppress freedom of expression.” (Pompeo slaps visa restrictions on Chinese accused of quashing dissent — Reuters) <br>

(March 10, 2017) The researchers propose building a 5-ton chemical laser that will be stationed in low-earth orbit as a combat platform capable of destroying satellites in orbit. Given funding by the Chinese military, which is in charge of China’s space program, the satellite-killing laser could be deployed by 2023. According to the article, an anti-satellite attack in space would employ a ground-based radar to identify a target satellite, a special camera to provide precision targeting and a deployable membrane telescope that would focus the laser beam on the target satellite. China’s space program is dual-use — supporting both civilian and military needs. For example, China’s Shenzhou and Tiangong manned spacecraft were used to perform military missions. It is conceivable that China could launch an orbiting laser gun disguised as a scientific module. The Chinese effort could neutralize decades of investment by the United States in its own directed-energy weapons, including lasers, electromagnetic railguns and high-power microwave arms. “And with their prolific network of espionage, it is likely that development is supported by foreign research they have acquired as well,” he said. In light of these threats, the United States should consider changing its long-held policy of not deploying arms in space.

(April  30,  2010) Conservatives  emphasize  an  altogether different  set  of  concerns.  For  them,  the  main disadvantage  of  a  VAT  is  that  it  would  be  a source  of  revenue  to  fund  a  large,  intrusive government. While  sorting  out  cause-and-effect  among  these  international differences  is  hard,  many  conservatives agree  with  Edward  C.  Prescott,  a  Nobel laureate  in  economics  whose  research  suggests  that  Europe’s  lower  income  is  largely attributable  to  its  higher  tax  rates. So  why,  if  these  two  tax  systems  are really  the  same,  are  conservatives  attracted to  the  flat  tax  and  repelled  by  the  VAT?  It is  because  the  flat  tax  is  usually  proposed as  a  substitute  for  our  current  tax  system, whereas  the  VAT  is  often  suggested  as  an addition  to  it.

(December 4, 2020) Nasa is paying a Colorado-based company $1 (£0.74) to collect a small sample of rocks from the moon. Nasa will be paying the companies for individual collections of lunar regolith between 50g and 500g in weight. The funding is so low because Nasa is only paying for the collection of the regolith, not any of the companies' development or transport costs, agency officials said. There are expected to be many scientific benefits to the mission, such as allowing firms to practice extracting resources from the lunar surface.

(December 2, 2020) The Earth continued to endure a period of significant heating in 2020 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). With data available from January to October this year, the WMO says 2020 is set to be around 1.2C above the baseline, but with a margin of error of 0.1C. "We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year's heat." Overall though the 2020 figure reinforces the view that climate warming, driven by human activities is persisting. The decade from 2011 to 2020 is the warmest yet recorded.

(December 1, 2020) After making astronomical discoveries for well over half a century, the radio telescope's 900-ton receiver platform, suspended by cables 450 feet (137 meters) above a 1,000-foot-wide (305 meters) bowl-shaped reflector dish, fell on Tuesday morning. The structure was already looking vulnerable after an auxiliary cable snapped in August, causing a 100-foot gash on the 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish. A main cable then broke in early November, prompting the NSF to announce the structure was beyond repair and would have to be demolished.

(December 1, 2020) China Coast Guard ship 5402 approached within two nautical miles of the Malaysian oil and gas blocks west of Luconia Shoals on Nov. 19, presumably warning the facilities to stop operations, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said in a report, citing marine traffic data and satellite imagery. The waters off Luconia Shoals saw a standoff between Chinese and Malaysian vessels in 2015. Both countries lay claims to sovereignty of the Luconia Shoals.

(December 1, 2020) “Short-range anti-aircraft missile systems are already on duty on the island of Iturup in Sakhalin Region. Now the air defence ‘heavy artillery’ has arrived.

(November 30, 2020) The report “Nato 2030”, prepared by a group of so-called “wise persons” and containing 138 proposals, comes amid growing doubts about the purpose and relevance of an alliance branded last year by French President Emmanuel Macron as “brain-dead”. “China is no longer the benign trading partner that the West had hoped for. It is the rising power of our century and Nato must adapt,” said one Nato diplomat who has seen the report, pointing to Chinese activity in the Arctic and Africa and to its heavy investments in European infrastructure.

(November 30, 2020) The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese firm China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC), accusing it of supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s efforts to undermine democracy. The US Treasury Department in a statement said the Chinese company supported the leftist government of Maduro in its “efforts to restrict internet service and conduct digital surveillance and cyber operations against political opponents”. CEIEC allegedly provided software, training and technical expertise to entities of Venezuela’s government. (US hits Chinese firm CEIEC with sanctions over Venezuela — Reuters via SCMP) <br>

(November 30, 2020) The short-term stimulus package is valued at $70 billion to $100 billion over roughly three years. Freeland said the government will track progress by monitoring such as employment rate, total hours worked and the level of unemployment in the economy to determine when to end the stimulus spending. O'Toole said the government's approach is to add to the national debtload rather than create the conditions that would get people back to work. After some initial stimulus spending, then-prime minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government cut federal spending across the board with a deficit reduction action plan (DRAP) that downsized the budgets of most departments and agencies by five to 10 per cent.

(November 30, 2020) While the breathtaking Whitsundays oasis is 80 per cent national park, the Chinese company controls the remaining 20 per cent and has used its power to padlock all access points to the otherwise government-owned park. She added that the beach, which is a known turtle nesting area, has been overrun with heavy machinery. 'We want to make a home here, we want to buy our piece of Australia, and China is making it very hard.' Ms Asbury added that it 'feels like Keswick Island has become the property of the Chinese Communist Party'.

那老妖到中堂里叫：“小的们，怎么没了灯光？只莫走了人也？”叫一声，没人答应；又叫一声，又没人答应；及取灯火来看时，只见地下血淋淋的三块肉饼，老王父子及唐僧、八戒俱在，只不见了行者、沙僧。点着火，前后赶看，忽见沙僧还背贴在廊下站哩；被他一把拿住捽倒，照旧捆了。又找寻行者，但见几层门尽皆破损，情知是行者打破走了；也不去追赶，将破门补的补，遮的遮，固守家业不题。 (西遊記 第九十回) <br>

行者叫道：“兄弟！不须在此叫唤。师父乐极生悲，已被妖精摄去了！”那几个和尚害怕道：“爷爷，怎见得是妖精摄去？”行者笑道：“原来你这伙凡人，累年不识，故被妖邪惑了，只说是真佛降祥，受此灯供。刚才风到处，现佛身者，就是三个妖精。我师父亦不能识，上桥顶就拜，却被他侮暗灯光，将器皿盛了油，连我师父都摄去。我略走迟了些儿，所以他三个化风而遁。” (西遊記 第九十一回) <br>

行者道：“呆子莫胡谈！且收拾行李。但恐师父着了急，来叫我们，却好进朝保护他。”八戒道：“哥哥又说差了。师父做了驸马，到宫中与皇帝的女儿交欢，又不是爬山蹱路，遇怪逢魔，要你保护他怎的！他那样一把子年纪，岂不知被窝里之事，要你去扶揝？”行者一把揪住耳朵，轮拳骂道：“你这个淫心不断的夯货！说那甚胡话！” (西遊記 第九十三回) <br>
