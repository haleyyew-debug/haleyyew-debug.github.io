(April 3, 2021) The huge project, which holds an estimated 2.4 billion tonnes of iron ore graded at over 65.5 per cent, could diversify China’s supply chain but may not cut out Canberra completely, analysts say.

(March 31, 2021) On China, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed with his predecessor, Michael Pompeo, that authorities were committing genocide in Xinjiang. More than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities were being detained in extrajudicial camps, while another two million were forced to attend “daytime reeducation training,” he said. “The trend lines on human rights continue to move in the wrong direction,” Blinken told reporters.

(March 31, 2021) The terms of China's loan deals with developing countries are unusually secretive and require borrowers to prioritise repayment of Chinese state-owned banks ahead of other creditors, a study of a cache of such contracts showed on Wednesday (March 31). These include confidentiality clauses that prevent borrowers from revealing the terms of the loans, informal collateral arrangements that benefit Chinese lenders over other creditors and promises to keep the debt out of collective restructurings - dubbed by the authors as "no Paris Club" clauses - the report said. The contracts also give substantial leeway for China to cancel loans or accelerate repayment, it added.

The diplomat said there should be "accountability for the past," positioning himself in contrast to his predecessor Mike Pompeo, who had called for China to be punished, per CNN. Blinken also expressed concern about a forthcoming WHO report on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak because of the Chinese government's role in helping author it.

(March 28, 2021) US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the military had shown its willingness to "sacrifice the lives of the people to serve the few." One activist in Mandalay told DW that soldiers were entering neighborhoods dressed as civilians "with concealed guns and weapons." "They are not just cracking down on the protesters," said David, whose name has been changed for his own safety. "They are now entering the neighborhood and shooting and beating and looting everything that's in their sight." The death toll from the military crackdown reached nearly 400 on Saturday.

(March 28, 2021) Dozens of people are dead following an attack on the town of Palma in northern Mozambique, according to a spokesperson from the country's defence department. The armed group is reported to have taken control of Palma, but those claims are hard to verify amid a communications blackout. "The UK wholeheartedly condemns the appalling violence in Cabo Delgado. It must stop. We stand with the people of Mozambique against terror." Northern Mozambique has been torn apart by an insurgency since 2017. Militants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group are behind the conflict in the predominantly Muslim region of Cabo Delgado. The fighting has left more than 2,500 people dead and 700,000 displaced.

(December 2009) With a large number of examples and a large space, however, some difficulties arise: 1. Checking all the previous examples over again for each modification is very expensive. 2. The search process may involve a great deal of backtracking. As we saw in Chapter 18, hypothesis space can be a doubly exponentially large place. ... As various hypotheses are found to be inconsistent with the examples, this disjunction shrinks, retaining only those hypotheses not ruled out. ... We already said that the hypothesis space is enormous, so how can we possibly write down this enormous disjunction? ... Every hypothesis more specific than some member of the G-set and more general than some member of the S-set is a consistent hypothesis. (That is, there are no “holes” between the boundaries.) ... Figure 19.5 shows the situation: there are no known examples outside S but inside G, so any hypothesis in the gap must be consistent. ... This may appear rather complicated at first, but from the definitions and with the help of Figure 19.4, it is not too hard to reconstruct the algorithm. ... No known examples lie in between the two sets of boundaries. ... The version space collapses—either S or G becomes empty, indicating that there are no consistent hypotheses for the training set. ... The problem of disjunction can be addressed by allowing only limited forms of disjunction or by including a generalization hierarchy of more general predicates.

(March 24, 2021) China is rapidly expanding its activities in Manila-claimed waters in the South China Sea, maritime moves that come amid lingering uncertainties in the US-Philippine strategic alliance. The US Embassy in Manila, however, was quick to declare, “We stand with the Philippines, our oldest treaty ally in Asia” and accused China of intimidating rival claimant states in the South China Sea through its armada of maritime militia forces. Emboldened by Manila’s acquiescence, Beijing has rapidly militarized disputed land features by deploying sophisticated military hardware to newly-reclaimed areas in the South China Sea. China’s increasing reliance on “gray zone” tactics to push its claims in the area culminated in the sinking of a Philippine fishing vessel by a suspected Chinese militia vessel in the Reed Bank area in mid-2019. Contrary to Duterte’s generally meek position, his top cabinet members and legislative allies have taken a dramatically tougher stance against China’s intrusions into Philippine-claimed waters. Despite those protests, there has been no sign of a Chinese militia force withdrawal from the contested area, which some in the Philippines view as the strategic cost of lingering uncertainties in the Philippine-US alliance.

(March 21, 2021) Although an international tribunal in 2016 invalidated China's claim to 90% of the South China Sea maritime region, Beijing does not recognize the ruling. The Reuters news agency on Sunday cited Philippines Defense Minister Delfin Lorenzana, saying the presence of the vessels, apparently still at the site, was "a clear provocative action of militarizing the area." "We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory." In recent years, China has built islands in the disputed waters, installing airstrips on some of them. The US has repeatedly condemned what it called China's attempts to bully neighbors with competing claims. (220 Chinese 'militia' boats gathered in South China Sea — DW News) <br>

(March 20, 2021) "We discussed opportunities to elevate the US-India major defense partnership, which is a priority of the Biden-Harris administration. And we'll do that through regional security cooperation and military to military interactions and defense trade," he added. The Quad held a summit last weekend, affirming their joint interest in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The members also agreed to cooperate on dealing with maritime and cybersecurity challenges from China. (US seeks to strengthen security ties with India — DW News) <br>

(March 19, 2021) “On economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners, and we will move forward on them in a way that totally protects and advances the interests of our workers and our businesses,” Blinken said. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi said that confrontation would be a “disaster” for both nations. Biden, who referred to Xi as a “thug” during his election campaign, said after the call that the United States needed to raise its game in the face of the Chinese challenge, or China would “eat our lunch.” “I have many policy disagreements with the Biden administration, but every single American should unite against Beijing’s tyrants,” Republican Senator Ben Sasse said in a statement.

(March 19, 2021) However, a US official said the subsequent talks behind closed doors had been "substantive, serious and direct" and ran over the planned two hours. In a blunt opening statement before the talks in private, Mr Blinken said the US would "discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies". "Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said. In later remarks via state media, Chinese officials said it had been the US, not China, that had violated protocol by exceeding the agreed time in opening remarks. They accused the US of making a "groundless attack on China's domestic and foreign policies". Mr Sullivan hit back, saying Washington did not seek a conflict with China, but added: "We will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends."

(March 19, 2021) Because access to Xinjiang is heavily restricted by the Chinese, Amnesty spoke to Uighurs who were able to flee Xinjiang before the repression of the Uighur people intensified in 2017. In November 2019, Mihriban and Ablikim received a permit from the Italian government to bring their children to join them, but the children were seized by Chinese police on the way and sent to a state-run orphanage, Amnesty said. Omer and Meryem Faruh, who fled to Turkey in late 2016, left their two youngest children, aged five and six, with grandparents because they did not yet have their own travel documents, Amnesty said. They found out later that the grandparents had been arrested and sent to a camp and have not heard from their children since.

Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting commanded the market’s undivided attention. And Powell did not disappoint: the FOMC’s statement declared that everything was terrible, the US economy was weak, inflation was low. As long as the US government can sell 5-year bonds at an after-inflation yield of about negative 2 percent, which means that investors are paying the Treasury to hold their money for them, the US government can run any kind of deficit it likes.

(March 17, 2021) The vice president said that Magufuli died at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, the Indian Ocean port that is Tanzania’s largest city.

He added: "If something really happens to me, I want everyone to boldly follow the path of democracy and freedom.

(March 17, 2021) The European Union's 27 ambassadors agreed on Wednesday to impose new sanctions on individuals from China and other countries over human rights abuses, two EU diplomats have said. They will be the first sanctions against Beijing since an EU arms embargo in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The embargo is still in place. The agreement on sanctions comes after a planned visit by EU ambassadors to China's Xinjiang region, where the Uighurs largely live, was refused permission over a request to see jailed Uighur academic Ilham Tohti.

(March 17, 2021) Austin was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks with South Korean officials on how best to counter the security risks posed by China's growing influence and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In first comments carried by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, Austin emphasized the importance of the US-South Korean alliance in the face of the threats from China and North Korea.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. "We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere," he said. (Asian women among eight killed at three spas — BBC) <br>

(March 16, 2021) There are no illusions in the Biden team. Ahead of the meeting Mr Blinken noted this was "not a strategic dialogue" and there was "no intent at this point for a series of follow-on engagements". If by "Cold War" one means a great titanic struggle involving all aspects of national power waged between two incompatible political systems, then clearly the US-China rivalry has echoes of the US-Soviet confrontation. So in superficial terms maybe the "Cold War" label appears appropriate, but how useful is it really? In the original Cold War, the Soviet Union and its allies were largely isolated from the world economy and subject to strict export controls. In stark contrast, China is a lynch-pin of the global economy, and its own economy is deeply integrated with that of the United States. But the Cold War model is deeply dangerous in a fundamental respect. In the final analysis, one side was actually defeated - the Soviet system was swept away on the tide of history. And many fear that seeing the US-China rivalry in these stark ideological terms could lead to miscalculation on both sides, and give Beijing in particular all the more reason to go to potentially catastrophic lengths to avoid a possible defeat. Beijing has in many ways stolen a march on Washington. But will its authoritarian drift hamper its economic progress? Can China cope with slowing economic growth and an ageing population? And will the Communist Party be able to retain the loyalty and support of Chinese society in the long-term? (Beyond the 'Cold War' cliche — BBC) <br>

(March 16, 2021) Multiple school principals have confirmed to Apple Daily that they have received calls from the education authority last week, claiming they were conducting a “survey” on whether and how many spy cameras have been installed on campus, as well as the locations and amount of money involved. The officials, however, did not ask for the schools’ opinion on bringing CCTV in classrooms. Lawyer Chong Yiu-kwong said it would be difficult to prove the necessity of installing CCTV in classrooms. It is unreasonable to invade a teachers’ privacy with cameras when he or she has no prior record of inappropriate behavior in class.

(March 16, 2021) According to a report by French online media La Lettre A on March 15, Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye wrote a "scathing letter" to Senator Alain Richard on Feb. 18, asking him to cancel his plan to lead a parliamentary delegation to visit Taiwan this summer. Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the same day that Beijing's "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy is not acceptable to any civilized country and stressed that Taiwan welcomed friends from around the world. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), meanwhile, condemned China for its efforts to suppress Taiwan's international space, saying such efforts will only deepen the distaste the Taiwanese people feel for the Chinese government.

(March 16, 2021) According to the latest statistics, the US remains the world’s largest arms exporter, increasing its global share of arms exports from 32% to 37% between 2011–15 and 2016–20. Exports by China, the world’s fifth-largest arms exporter in 2016–20, decreased by 7.8% between 2011–15 and 2016–20. Chinese arms exports accounted for 5.2% of total arms exports in 2016–20. Asia and Oceania was the largest importing region for major arms, receiving 42% of global arms transfers in 2016–20. India, Australia, China, South Korea and Pakistan were the biggest importers in the region. In 2016–20 Russia supplied 30% of arms imports by countries in sub-Saharan Africa, China 20%, France 9.5% and the US 5.4%. (US leads arms exporters, China sales fall — Asia Times) <br>

(March 15, 2021) The report revealed that after strong protest to America through diplomatic channels failed to sway the plan, Beijing responded with threats with military actions.

Alireza Tangsiri, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards’ naval unit, told state TV the base had equipment to detect enemy signals. The report said the base’s “electronic warfare equipment” included radar, monitoring, simulation and disruption systems.

(March 14, 2021) Reforms to Hong Kong’s electoral laws are expected to take place in May, a senior Hong Kong politician said after China’s top legislature decided that the city’s election system needs to be “improved” to ensure patriots are in power. Tam emphasized that those who wish to enter the Legislative Council to “make trouble” or to overthrow or subvert the government will not be allowed to run for election.

(March 13, 2021) The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday designated five Chinese tech firms as posing an "unacceptable risk" to national security. The companies include Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, along with ZTE, Hytera Communications, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology. The US may work with international partners to deal with not only  Chinese tech, but also other issues such as Beijing's human rights abuses against the Uighur minority and it aggressive stance toward territorial waters in the South China Sea.

(March 12, 2021) "Chances are the harassment by Chinese Coast Guard assets will be more serious than that of Chinese military planes," said Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst at the government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research, at the forum. That's because "Coast Guard ships operate with more flexibility due to their supposed civilian nature" and can carry out "gray zone" tactics, which refer to moves by a state to achieve its objectives but that are less likely to cause a military conflict, Su warned. Incidents in which Chinese Coast Guard ships used excessive force while operating in waters claimed by China, such as waters near Vietnam and Malaysia, have been common in the past, according to Su. According to the Foreign Ministry, more than 100 incidents of "harassment" by Chinese warplanes were recorded around Taiwan in 2020, involving 1,807 sorties. Although the region has yet to see the Chinese Coast Guard actually enforce the new law, it is a common practice of Beijing to make a law that exerts pressure on other countries and implement it later when the time is right, Akio Yaita, a Japanese journalist, said at the forum.

The failed plan could hamper Hong Kong’s bid in becoming an information hub in the region, Francis Fong, president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, told Apple Daily.

(March 11, 2021) Mathias Bölinger, a DW journalist based in China, said while the situation in China has deteriorated over the last few years, it has dramatically worsened over the last year. “It has become harder to find interviewees and scheduled interviews are often cancelled,” Bölinger said. He added that Chinese people are less willing to talk about political topics and are often warned not to give interviews to foreign journalists. Foreign correspondents are also facing more and more restrictions in other aspects. Steffen Wurzel, a Shanghai-based correspondent for the ARD, also pointed out to DW that the working conditions for foreign journalists in China have deteriorated dramatically in the last year. He said the biggest problem is that almost all topics have been highly politicized by the Chinese leadership during the coronavirus outbreak. “Despite what China says about wanting to be open to the world and to show everybody what a vibrant society it is, they clearly restrict reporting of anything that doesn’t adhere to their vision,” Steven Lee Myers, Beijing bureau chief for the New York Times told the FCCC. "It’s suggestive of a climate that’s not going to get any better." (Foreign correspondents in China face growing restrictions — DW News) <br>

(March 9, 2021) At least 98 people have died from injuries sustained in a series of explosions in Equatorial Guinea, the health ministry said on Monday after volunteers searched the rubble for bodies. "Because the damages are not only physical but also mental," the ministry said. A fire near a weapons depot at the city's Nkoantoma Military Base is believed to have caused the blasts. He said the explosion had damaged nearly all homes and buildings in Bata, a city with just over 200,000 residents, adding that he had ordered a probe to hold those responsible to account. The oil-producing nation is under economic duress, facing a double shock because of the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in the price of crude oil, which accounts for about three-fourths of its revenue.

(March 9, 2021) The report considered thousands of testimonies from exiled Uyghurs and official Chinese government documents as evidence. Up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to have been detained in the 1,400 internment facilities scattered across Xinjiang since 2014, the report found. The four-page UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which came into force in 1951, aims to prevent and punish actions of genocide in war and in peacetime.

(March 8, 2021) A French billionaire aviation industrialist and member of parliament has died in a helicopter crash along with the pilot, authorities said. A judicial inquiry for eventual manslaughter charges is underway after Sunday’s crash in the town of Touques in Normandy, according to the regional prosecutor’s office in Lisieux. He held executive positions at the family-owned Dassault Group as well as serving in the lower house of parliament as a lawmaker from the conservative Republicans party since 2002.

(March 6, 2021) The US is expressing growing concern over a hack on Microsoft's Exchange email software that the tech company has blamed on China. "This is an active threat," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday. "Everyone running these servers - government, private sector, academia - needs to act now to patch them." Microsoft said hackers had used its mail server to attack their targets. It is reported that tens of thousands of US organisations may be impacted. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributed the attacks with "high confidence" to a "state-sponsored threat actor" based in China which they named Hafnium. Although Hafnium is based in China, it allegedly conducts its operations primarily from leased virtual private servers in the US, Microsoft said.

(March 5, 2021) The United States condemns China’s “continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular news briefing. Price called Beijing’s moves “a direct attack on Hong Kong’s autonomy ... freedoms and the democratic processes.” “I don’t think anyone is satisfied yet, with the international response to what has taken place in Xinjiang. And that’s precisely why we are, in many ways, galvanizing the world, galvanizing collective action, to make clear that these sort of abuses against human rights in Xinjiang and elsewhere will not be tolerated,” he said.

(March 5, 2021) The World Uyghur Congress accused the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of ignoring an ethics complaint it filed last year to move the 2022 Winter Games out of Beijing due to China's alleged human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities. "The IOC can no longer hide behind 'political neutrality' to justify its decision to host the games in a country that is currently committing genocide and crimes against humanity," Dolkun said Friday. "Real people are suffering from these crimes every day and the Olympics and the sponsors risk being forever tainted with the intense suffering of my people."

(March 4, 2021) The NPC meeting runs in parallel to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a meeting of the most powerful political advisory body in the country. That already began on Thursday, and collectively the gatherings are referred to as the "Two Sessions". We will also see the NPC formally approve the 14th Five-Year-Plan that was announced at the end of last year. China is the only major economy in the world that publishes a five-year policy plan, and it has been doing so since 1953. Such actions, he said, "can bring companies such as Huawei to their knees, and constrain future economic growth as well as the strength of Chinese industry." But many in Hong Kong and rights groups have accused China of eroding those freedoms and autonomy in recent years. There were months of violent protests in 2019. China scrapped presidential term limits in 2018, which would allow Mr Xi to remain beyond his two terms. (China set to overhaul HK electoral system — BBC) <br>

(March 4, 2021) This issue has long preoccupied Beijing, said Caroline Meinhardt, a research associate at the Berlin-based China research institute MERICS. But following this strategy means the government faces a challenge in the long run, she added. "Significantly strengthening demand-led growth would require a significant redistribution of income to ordinary households," the expert told DW. Nis Grünberg, a colleague of Meinhardt's at MERICS, said: "The focus in the coming years will be on strengthening the country's own economy and industry, and expanding social systems, especially in health and education." As planned, the victory over poverty comes in the 100th year of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. "However, the task now is to raise the hundreds of millions of Chinese living in precarious economic and employment conditions to a middle-class standard of living, and to combat growing inequality," Grünberg said. "More investment in education and the creation of jobs, also outside urban centers, will be necessary to maintain the standard achieved." "At the moment, China is still far from becoming technologically independent," Meinhardt said. "Thanks to enormous government support and private investment, China is likely to produce significant achievements in some subsectors in the coming years," she added. ... Climate policy is the only area where President Xi Jinping can currently win friends and allies on the international stage, especially in the West. Pointing to the pandemic, authorities postponed elections to the Hong Kong Legislative Council by over a year. They are now expected to take place by December.

(March 4, 2021) Zhang Yesui, a spokesman for the National People’s Congress, said on Thursday it had the constitutional power to “improve” Hong Kong’s system and a draft decision would be discussed during the annual parliamentary session which opens on Friday. Most of the main pro-democracy politicians and activists are either in jail or in exile after authorities cracked down on the mass anti-government protests of 2019, culminating with the imposition of a national security law last year. Hong Kong’s Cable TV and Now TV, citing unnamed sources, said after Zhang spoke the changes would include increasing the size of an election committee to select Hong Kong’s leader from 1,200 to 1,500, and the city’s legislature from 70 to 90 seats. Currently only half of the 70 seats in the Legislative Council are directly elected, a proportion which is likely to shrink once the new changes are implemented. The moves will reduce democratic representation in both the Legislative Council and the election committee, which must convene before Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s five-year term ends in July next year.

(March 4, 2021) Announcing a new executive order paving the way for sanctions on the generals and their businesses, Biden said on Feb. 10 that the United States was taking steps to prevent the generals from “improperly having access” to $1 billion in Myanmar government funds. Two sources told Reuters the executive order was designed to provide the New York Fed with the legal authority to hold the $1 billion of Myanmar reserves indefinitely. An attempt to empty the account was made on Feb. 4, but was blocked automatically by processes that had been put in place at the New York Fed before the coup, two of the sources said. One source said that was because transactions involving Myanmar require extra scrutiny as the country last year was placed on the international Financial Action Task Force’s “gray list” for money laundering concerns, in part because of the risk of proceeds from drug trafficking being washed through its banks.

(March 4, 2021) The spending figure, set at 1.35 trillion yuan ($208.47 billion) in the national budget released on Friday, is closely watched as a barometer of how aggressively the country will beef up its military.

(March 3, 2021) China is the only country with the power to seriously challenge the U.S. ability to shape the global system of “rules, values and relationships,” he said. “Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be,” Blinken said. Engaging with China “from a position of strength,” as the administration seeks to do, “requires standing up for our values when human rights are abused in Xinjiang or when democracy is trampled in Hong Kong, because if we don’t, China will act with even greater impunity,” Blinken said.

(March 2, 2021) But our evidence suggests that - alongside the re-education camps built across Xinjiang in recent years - the policy involves a high risk of coercion and is similarly designed to assimilate minorities by changing their lifestyles and thinking. The video report, broadcast by China's Communist Party-run news channel, shows a group of officials in the centre of the village, sitting under a red banner advertising jobs in Anhui Province, 4,000km away. After two full days, the reporter's narration says, not a single person from the village has come forward to sign up, and so the officials begin moving from house to house. What follows is some of the most compelling footage of China's massive campaign to transfer Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang into factory and manual labouring jobs, often considerable distances from their homes. "The Chinese government continually says that people are volunteering to engage in these programmes, but this absolutely reveals that this is a system of coercion that people are not allowed to resist." This overarching goal of assimilating Uighurs into China's majority Han culture is made clear by an in-depth Chinese study of Xinjiang's job-transfer scheme, circulated to senior Chinese officials and seen by the BBC. Written by a group of academics from Nankai University in the Chinese city of Tianjin, it concludes that the mass labour transfers are "an important method to influence, meld and assimilate Uighur minorities" and bring about a "transformation of their thinking." The Huafu Textile Company is located on the edge of a grey industrial estate in the city of Huaibei, in China's eastern province of Anhui. Amazon told the BBC that it does not tolerate the use of forced labour and that where it finds products that do not meet its supply chain standards, it removes them from sale. Interviews recorded at the scene suggest the Uighur workers were free to leave the factory during their leisure time, but at other factories visited for the research, the evidence was more mixed.

(March 2, 2021) The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which oversees a system for countries to share recognition of patents, said China filed 68,720 applications last year while the United States filed 59,230. Daren Tang, WIPO director-general, said the rise in Chinese filings was part of a longer-term trend for higher applications from Asia more broadly, with South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia all submitting more applications last year. Unlike after the 2008 financial crisis when filings fell sharply, overall filings via WIPO’s system were up 4% overall in 2020 to a new record despite the COVID-19-induced slowdown, it said. Singapore’s Tang began his term in October and received strong support from Western countries including the United States in a highly politicised race against a Chinese candidate for the top job last year.
