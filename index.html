(Nov. 1, 2020) Typhoon Goni made landfall in the Philippines early Sunday with sustained winds up to 135 miles an hour, leaving at least 10 people dead in the Bicol region of Luzon. ... And now climate change is exacerbating the Philippines’ exposure to natural disasters, making it one of the most vulnerable countries on the planet, scientists say. ... As sea-surface temperatures rise, the Philippines’ positioning in warm ocean waters means the country is being subjected to both bigger and more frequent tropical storms. ... The Asian Development Bank says that more than 23,000 people in the Philippines died from natural hazards from 1997 to 2016 as the warming planet brought more powerful storms. (NY Times) <br>

(NOV 1, 2020) A top aide to Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has stepped down after admitting he helped fund a contentious report alleging links between former US vice-president Joe Biden's son and China, ... On Friday, NBC published an investigation saying the 64-page dossier had "questionable authorship and anonymous sourcing". The investigation found the listed author, a supposed Swiss security analyst called Martin Aspen, was a fabricated identity and that his picture had been created using software. ... Lai, 71, has long been a thorn in the side of Beijing and has spoken favourably of Trump's willingness to confront China - the only major Hong Kong tycoon willing to do so publicly. (Strait Times) <br>

(November 1, 2020) The testimony of police officers was sufficiently suspicious for District Court judge Sham Siu-man to acquit seven young Hongkongers on Saturday of rioting in a protest on Aug. 31 last year.

(Oct 29, 2020) At some point over the next six weeks, Freeland will table a fiscal and economic update that might include an updated tally of how much the pandemic and federal emergency measures have cost to date — and an estimate of how much the Liberal government proposes to spend in the years ahead as part of its plan to "build back better." ... Freeland insisted Wednesday that the Liberal government's approach is not based solely on "heart" — on concern for vulnerable Canadians — but is also grounded in "prudent, dispassionate economic calculus." ... All that said, Freeland also insisted that she is "not among those who think Canada should have a fling with Modern Monetary Theory" — the hip school of thought that proposes a particularly cavalier approach to government spending. ... Conservative leader Erin O'Toole has said already that any government led by him might need a decade to balance the budget. ... But the next argument about spending will, of course, still be as much about politics and psychology as it is about math. ... For 25 years, Canadians have been told that fiscal cleanliness is next to godliness — that government budgets are like household budgets, where spending more than you take in almost always ends badly.

(October 25, 2020) British Columbia voters appear to have rewarded John Horgan’s pandemic gamble by giving his NDP a majority mandate. While we wait for the full final results to come in—and that will take weeks—we can guess at some of the tea leaves. ... in September, another premier of another minority government, that one only two years old, ended up with a majority after dropping the writ. That was Progressive Conservative Blaine Higgs, the premier of New Brunswick. ... taking responsibility for the fate of the controversial Site C hydroelectric dam project in northeast B.C., initiated under Christy Clark’s Liberals. ... The NDP government has said the $12-billion project—an amount that keeps rising and could again—is not one it would have pursued. ... With Horgan accused of covering up the extent of Site C’s problems, communicating its fate will be his first big test in round two of his premiership. It will no longer matter that he (arguably) didn’t get himself into this mess. It will matter what he does about it. (Macleans) <br>

(14 July, 2020) The UK government has announced a series of measures to remove the Chinese phone-maker Huawei from the UK's 5G mobile networks. It will ban UK mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and they will have to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. ...

He is also a member of China's Communist party. ... Washington has banned US firms from doing business with Huawei (for example, designing and producing chips) and wants its allies to ban it from their 5G networks. Australia and New Zealand have joined the US. ... But deciding to ban Huawei from 5G in the UK, could risk Chinese retaliation such as a possible cyber attack. (Tim Bowler, BBC News) <br>

(Jun 20, 2020) Military pallbearers carry the casket of Sub-Lt. Abbigail Cowbrough during a repatriation ceremony for the six Canadian Armed Forces personnel killed in a military helicopter crash in the Mediterranean. ... And in announcing a resumption of Cyclone flights earlier this week, Air Force officials said investigators have been able to recreate the circumstances surrounding the crash using information from the Cyclone's flight-data recorders. The problem occurred as the helicopter was coming around to land on HMCS Fredericton, officials said. The pilot attempted to make a number of manoeuvres while the Cyclone's "flight director," or autopilot, was still engaged. Rather than turning off, the autopilot started to work against the human pilot before the helicopter crashed into the water at high speed. (The Canadian Press via CBC) <br>

(April 24, 2020) Canada's deadliest mass shooting began with the gunman's assault on his girlfriend, who escaped, hid in the woods overnight and emerged in the morning with information crucial to stopping him, police said Friday. ... Darren Campbell, a superintendent with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Nova Scotia, said the assault and escape were a “significant incident” that could have been the “catalyst” for Gabriel Wortman’s nearly 14-hour rampage in the eastern province last weekend. But he said he was not discounting that it was premeditated. ... The RCMP faced criticism this week for its response to the attack and questions about how Wortman could have evaded officers for nearly 14 hours. “I’ve been a police officer for almost 30 years now, and I can’t imagine any more horrific set of circumstances [than] when you’re trying to search for someone that looks like you,” Campbell said.

Some 55 million people, including farmers like Bao, have been affected. ...

(July 16, 2020) Attorney General William P. Barr on Thursday accused Beijing of pressuring American business leaders to promote pro-China policies in the United States, and suggested that U.S. executives who do so might be violating U.S. lobbying laws. In a speech in Michigan, Barr accused U.S. companies of “kowtowing” to China for the sake of short-term profits and alleged that China’s Communist Party has recently “stepped up” efforts to “coerce” American business executives to push its agenda with U.S. lawmakers. “Hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a ‘friendly face’ on pro-regime policies,” Barr said in remarks at the Gerald R.

Those evicted, mostly Igbo Nigerians, insisted that they had paid their rent, had valid visas and the right paperwork, and had no contact with anybody infected with COVID-19. ... China’s response has been to deny that any problem exists. ... The crisis in Guangzhou only reaffirmed the underlying racism of Chinese society. ...

(March 20, 2020) Vice President Mike Pence is in charge of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus.
