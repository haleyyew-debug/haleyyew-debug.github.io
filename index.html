(January 6, 2021) Former defence head of China analysis Paul Monk says the “real work” which China is trying to carry out in Australia is not simply trying to get ethnic Chinese into positions of influence, but rather winning leading Australians. “Much of our Chinese community came here from the PRC – or for that matter elsewhere in Asia – because they wanted what this country had to offer,” Mr Monk told Sky News host Cory Bernardi. “What the Communist Party has been doing is not so much using any significant proportion of that community for its nefarious purposes, but rather seeking to intimidate it, to infiltrate it, to take over its independent media, and that’s something we want to protect.” (China’s ‘real work’ aims to ‘win’ leading Australians: Monk — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(January 6, 2021) The MRC said the Chinese notification assured the flow “will be gradually restored to its normal operation status on January 25”, without specifying an exact volume rate. The new Mekong Dam Monitor on its Facebook page on Tuesday said China had not notified neighbors when the Jinghong dam starting restricting waters on Dec. 31, “causing a sudden 1 metre drop in river level” downstream that could devastate the fish population. Beijing has rejected suggestions its Mekong dams harm downstream countries. (China notifies Mekong River neighbours it is holding back waters — Reuters) <br>

(January 5, 2021) In his new book, The Invention of China, journalist Bill Hayton reconstructs the nation-building process of modern China. He shows how nationalist-minded intellectuals and activists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries took up Western concepts of people, language, territory and history, among other things, to paint a picture of a millennia-old nation-state that, in fact, never existed. For significant periods of the past 5,000 years, there were entirely separate states and peoples living on the territory of what is now China. The idea that there's been a single state called China, a single nation going back to ancient history, isn't supported by the evidence. And Xi now seems committed to the idea that there has to be a single way of being Chinese, a single way of being part of the Chinese nation, and he's going to impose that with a very heavy hand. It's really important for them to project continuity back from the past because it cuts down the possibility of criticizing the current situation. If you can convince people that things have always been this way, then there's no reason for them to question why they shouldn't continue to be this way in the future. And this use of history is possibly the most important psychological tool in the in the toolkit of the People's Republic. The idea that you could try to re-educate a million people is not something that we've ever seen in any other colonial situation. And they are trying to stop discussion of alternatives not just in their own country, but also in other countries. Companies are penalized if they, for example, mention Taiwan as a separate place on their websites. Universities get into trouble if they allow the Dalai Lama to come and speak on their campus. I think we have to insist on our own values and stand up to our own beliefs. We must also insist on the right to ask questions, to have different points of view and so forth. (History is 'China's most important psychological tool' — DW News) <br>

(January 5, 2021) The World Health Organisation claims its international team of experts has been refused entry into Wuhan over a "visa clearance issue" by Chinese officials. Beijing has delayed the arrival of the team of 10 international scientists for several months, inundating them with a number of logistical demands and rules. In a rare criticism of the Asian power, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gebhreyesus told reporters China's officials were yet to finalise necessary visa clearances for the team's arrival to the mainland.

(January 5, 2021) U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order banning transactions using eight Chinese software applications. According to Reuters, the order targets Alipay, WeChat pay, Camscanner among five other popular Chinese-owned apps... and the Commerce Department is now tasked with outlining exactly what type of transactions are banned under this measure. President Trump previously expressed discomfort about the large user bases and access to sensitive data that the Chinese software-makers hold.

(January 5, 2021) In his opening speech, Kim said the country had achieved a “miraculous victory” by bolstering its power and global prestige since the last meeting, referring to military advances that culminated in successful tests in 2017 of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland. But the five-year economic strategy he set forth in 2016 had failed to deliver, he said, calling for a boost in North Korea’s self-reliance to tackle internal and outside challenges hindering its progress.

(December 28, 2020) Vulnerable Shia and Alawi populations, under pressure from ISIS, welcomed the security of Shia militias supported by Iran. The grave abuses of Iranian-backed Shia militia and Assad’s forces, in turn, convinced vulnerable Sunni populations that ISIS protection was their only recourse. Iranian malign  influence  and  activities  in  Syria,  coupled  with  the  failure  of  the  Assad  regime  to  secure  and serve the Syria people, have ensured that the grievances that ISIS exploited have not been resolved and have only deepened, thereby enabling the regeneration of ISIS. ... Iran  has  sought  to  prolong  the  conflict  to  challenge  its  main  regional  rival,  Saudi  Arabia. U.S. naval forces have interdicted multiple shipments of Iranian weapons bound for the Houthis  in  Yemen. Iranian  supported  UAV  and  missile  attacks  from  Yemen  have  undermined  peace  efforts  and  have threatened  to  escalate  the  conflict  even  further. The Iranian hand in  these  recent  attacks  is  evident  in  recovered  missile  debris  from  several  attacks  that  are  unique  to Iranian missiles, including components stamped with a logo signifying the letters SBI, used by the Iranian company Shahid Bagheri Industries. ... Iran’s support for Palestinian terrorist groups serves only to further its own strategic interests and threaten our partner and ally Israel while coming at a high cost to the Palestinian people. ... Iranian  officials,  including  high-level  IRGC commanders, have repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea through which 20 percent of global petroleum shipments pass. Iran’s  threat  to  the  free  flow  of commerce  manifested  itself in  May and June  of 2019,  when  IRGCN  personnel placed  and  detonated limpet  mines on six commercial vessels. Soon after the second limpet mine attack, on June 19 the IRGC used a surface-to-air missile to shoot down a U.S. UAV transiting the  Strait  of  Hormuz. ... Since its founding, the Islamic Republic has frequently resorted to kidnapping and wrongful detentions for political gain, a pattern of behavior that has also played out at sea.

“Down with the six theologians, with their white surplices!” “Are those the theologians? I thought they were the white geese given by Sainte-Geneviève to the city, for the fief of Roogny.” “Down with the doctors!” “Down with the cardinal disputations, and quibblers!” “My cap to you, Chancellor of Sainte-Geneviève! You have done me a wrong. ’Tis true; he gave my place in the nation of Normandy to little Ascanio Falzapada, who comes from the province of Bourges, since he is an Italian.” “That is an injustice,” said all the scholars. “Down with the Chancellor of Sainte-Geneviève!” ... Meanwhile, the sworn bookseller of the university, Master Andry Musnier, was inclining his ear to the furrier of the king’s robes, Master Gilles Lecornu. “I tell you, sir, that the end of the world has come. No one has ever beheld such outbreaks among the students! It is the accursed inventions of this century that are ruining everything,—artilleries, bombards, and, above all, printing, that other German pest. No more manuscripts, no more books! printing will kill bookselling. It is the end of the world that is drawing nigh.” (Victor Hugo, Notre-Dame de Paris, Book 1 Chapter 1, 1831) <br>

(January 5, 2021) But scholars said the revisions are nothing new. Cai, a former professor of the CCP’s top academy, called the amendments a setback of the party. “The idea is to better control the party, not to allow democratic rights of party members,” she told Radio Free Asia. It also stressed that party members should adhere to “Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.” “It means that all 90 million party members should revolve around its leader … that’s why I think the party has become a zombie and the 90 million are now slaves,” Cai said.

(January 5, 2021) With Chevron and perhaps ExxonMobil heading for the exits, active exploration at a virtual standstill and production on an increasingly downward spiral, Indonesia’s government needs to conduct radical regulatory surgery before its oil and gas industry is doomed by the onrushing era of renewable energy. Exploration has fallen by an average of 23% over the past decade. According to government data, the number of exploratory wells plunged from 64 in 2014 to 26 in 2019 and only 18 last year, partly because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and partly as a result of sagging global oil and gas prices. Inpex turned down an overture from the China National Overseas Oil Corp (CNOOC) for political, technical and what one source describes as “bad business chemistry issues,” leaving the company to contemplate at least a decade-long delay in developing Marsela’s Abadi field. In particular, they want to see significant changes to the cost recovery scheme, under which the government reimburses companies for upstream-related costs in exchange for a higher share – up to 85% — for each company’s earnings from oil and gas blocks. “In other words, Indonesia can choose to implement incentives and measures which it believes will make it more attractive (as countries like Egypt and Columbia have done in recent years), or wait to negotiate with foreign investors from an increasingly weak bargaining position.” (Death knell tolls for Indonesia’s oil and gas — Asia Times) <br>

(January 5, 2021) Ellen and Rafael Robles tried to have everything in order for Monday morning when their son, Bento, started school virtually after the holiday break rather than in person: a good desk, chair, headphones and an iPad. "He's working at her [home] office with her computer, and she's working from his desk with his iPad," said Rafael Robles. It can be tough getting back into school routines following the winter break, but students in Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario are facing additional challenges this week due to the fact that they're hitting the books virtually — for at least a week — rather than returning in person, a measure several education ministries announced late last year to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. (Students struggle as school goes online-only in 4 provinces after Christmas break — CBC) <br>

(January 5, 2021) Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The tiny, gas- and oil-rich state denied the accusation and rejected the conditions for ending the partial blockade, including closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera broadcast network. Qatar's only land border was closed; ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports; and much of the region's airspace was closed to Qatari aircraft. Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait served as a mediator in the dispute. Kuwaiti mediation efforts appeared to make little progress until late last year, when the Trump administration intensified pressure on all sides for an end to the stand-off that thwarted their efforts to assemble an alliance of Sunni-led states to counter Iran and its proxies.

(January 5, 2021 Leaders of the Gulf countries signed a document, although the contents were not immediately released. Ahead of the gathering, Kuwait had announced that Saudi Arabia, which along with allies boycotted Doha in mid-2017, would reopen its airspace and borders to Qatar. All the states are U.S. allies. Qatar hosts the region’s largest U.S. military base, Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host U.S. troops. ... The other countries had set Doha 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera TV, shuttering a Turkish base, cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.

(January 5, 2021) The provincial government-run Hebei Daily said the province had entered “wartime mode”, meaning investigation teams would be set up at provincial, city and district levels to trace the close contacts of those who have tested positive. Hebei would resolutely act as the “political moat” around Beijing and strictly prevent the virus from spreading outside the province, the report said. Beijing is scheduled to host China’s annual parliamentary meeting in March. Last year’s gathering was postponed by more than two months because of the coronavirus outbreak.

(January 4, 2021) A city near Los Angeles closed outdoor seating spaces on public property starting Sunday evening amid a spike in COVID-19 cases across the county. Starting at 10 p.m. on Sunday, tables and chairs in outdoor seating spaces in Manhattan beach were removed until further notice, the city said. Manhattan Beach Mayor Suzanne Hadley urged residents to 'stay home if possible, and mainly go out for work and essentials, or to exercise outdoors.'

(January 3, 2021) Hanoi is proceeding with joint drilling ventures with Japanese firms in the disputed waterway despite the failure of similar projects with other countries. But analysts say China is likely to test Vietnam through maritime provocations if the energy ventures go ahead. With field development plans already approved by the Vietnamese government for Blocks 05-1B and 05-1C, production appears to be close at hand. Operations in a nearby field were halted after a deal between PetroVietnam and the Spanish firm Repsol was cancelled in 2017, allegedly under Chinese threats of military attacks. The following year, Repsol pulled out of its final concession with PetroVietnam. But while Vietnamese officials know well the risks that come with drilling in the South China Sea, there is hope in Hanoi that their Japanese business venture will succeed.

(December 28, 2020) President Trump  offered  the  Iranian  regime  a  choice:  either  negotiate  a  new, comprehensive deal or face unprecedented U.S. sanctions and manage economic  collapse.  Since  then, the  Islamic  Republic  chose  the  latter, rejecting diplomacy and doubling  down on its  revolutionary  agenda. Our sanctions have denied Iran more than 90% of its oil export revenue, depriving the regime access to well over $70 billion in income that could have  otherwise  gone  to  fund  terror  operations  –  while  preserving  avenues  for  humanitarian trade  and  assistance. Sadly, since we last published this report, the Iranian regime has found new ways to harm Iranians and recklessly extort the international community. In an attempt to hide its actions from the world, the regime simultaneously imposed a near-total shutdown of access to the internet. We continue to stand with the Iranian people, and have rolled out sanctions  and  visa  restrictions  on  a  host  of  Iranian  officials  directly  responsible  for  the lethal  crackdown  in  November  2019.  Corrupt  and  repressive  regime  officials,  not  the  Iranian people, are the targets of the Maximum Pressure Campaign. (A LETTER FROM U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE, MICHAEL  R.

(January 3, 2021) The 11 Republican senators and senators-elect, led by Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. Citing a precedent from 1877 - when a bi-partisan committee was formed to investigate after both parties claimed victory in three states - they urged Congress to appoint a commission for an "emergency 10-day audit of election returns in the disputed states". Mr Pence "welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people", Mr Short said. "I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?" [Romney] said in a statement.

(January 3, 2021) Germany, by December 17, had signed off on permissions to export weapons and military equipment worth €752 million to Egypt. Permission was also granted to German arms companies for deals worth over €305.1 million to Qatar, over €51 million to the United Arab Emirates, €23.4 million for Kuwait and around €22.9 million to Turkey. Licenses were granted to Jordan totaling €1.7 million and Bahrain amounting to €1.5 million. The United Nations humanitarian office puts the number of those who have died as a result of the 6-year-old war in Yemen at an estimated 233,000. This includes 131,000 from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure.

(January 2, 2021) A domestic high-speed rail network in Malaysia alone is not feasible and likely to end up a white elephant if it is built, transport analysts said. The Malaysian government had, prior to the expiry of the suspension period of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project, announced that it will conduct a study on the viability of a domestic HSR network, with the line ending in Johor Baru in Malaysia instead of Jurong East in Singapore.

(January 1, 2021) This remains short of the 90% required to make a nuclear bomb. But under the 2015 agreement Iran was supposed to keep enrichment below 4%. Iran breached the 3.67% purity cap imposed by the nuclear deal in 2019 but the enrichment level had remained steady at up to 4.5% since then. However the increase to 20% was mandated in a law passed by Iran's parliament last month ... The bill required the Iranian government to resume enriching uranium to 20% if sanctions on the country's oil and financial sectors were not eased in two months. The 2015 deal - signed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US - was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief. President Trump pulled out of the agreement in May 2018, calling it "decaying and rotten". However the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China all hope it can be revived.

(December 30, 2020) Coming to a South China Sea wartime theater of war soon — ship fired laser weapons, submarine launched drones and hypersonic missiles. Gilday’s comments mirror fast-moving efforts to arm amphibious ships, destroyer ships and even aircraft carriers with low-cost, high-impact offensive and defensive laser weapons, National Interest reported. Lasers are not only stealthy, but they are also precise and scalable, meaning laser bands can be combined to strengthen the attack, increase power, or conversely be set to “stun” or merely disable an enemy asset without needing a full kill. The promise of lasers is even inspiring the Navy to work with the Missile Defense Agency on ultimately developing ship-fired lasers able to take out higher-flying ballistic missiles. ... UUVs used in this role typically have a mixture of sensors, including side-scan sonars and bathymetric sensors, to create detailed maps of the seabed and otherwise identify potential hazards or other objects of interest. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in October that the service will deploy new hypersonic weapons on all 69 of its guided missile destroyers. The new missile, Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), is designed to travel at hypersonic speeds to quickly target emerging threats. Hypersonic speeds are defined as speeds above Mach 5, or 3,836 miles per hour. (US Navy eyes laser weapons, drones and hypersonics — Asia Times) <br>

(July 19, 2007) Short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) are obtained with paired-pulse studies and reflect interneuron influences in the cortex.(Ziemann et al., 1996) In such studies, an initial conditioning stimulus is given—enough to activate cortical neurons, but small enough so that no descending influence on the spinal cord can be detected and there is no MEP. A second test stimulus, at suprathreshold level, follows at a short interval. Intracortical inf luences initiated by the conditioning stimulus modulate the amplitude of the MEP produced by the test stimulus. At very short intervals, less than 5 ms, there is inhibition, and at intervals between 8 and 30 ms, there is facilitation (Figure 6).

(January 1, 2021) The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it will delist three Chinese telecommunications firms based on claimed links with its military. The companies earn all of their revenue in China and have no significant presence in the US. The delisting is seen more as a symbolic blow amid heightened geo-political tensions between the US and China.

Mr. Gohmert named Mr. Pence as the sole defendant, which the Justice Department noted is “ironically the very person whose power they seek to promote.” According to a court filing, Mr. Gohmert’s lawyers attempted to reach an agreement with Mr. Pence regarding the lawsuit, but those discussions were unsuccessful. The lawsuit “has zero legal merit and is yet another sabotage of our democracy,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a statement.

(Dec 22, 2020) This bill became the vehicle for passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a major government funding bill, which also included economic stimulus provisions due to the coronavirus pandemic. The bill passed overwhelmingly and with bipartisan support in the House through two roll call votes on Dec. 21, 2020. The first vote was on the portion of the bill for the appropriations for some federal departments including Commerce, Justice, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security, and some federal components including the White House and the District of Columbia. The second vote was on the remaining portion of the bill, which included appropriations for the remainder of the federal government as well as coronavirus stimulus and relief and many other miscellaneous provisions. It also passed the Senate overwhelmingly late that night. This bill was originally introduced as the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act.

(October 9, 2020 A fire that ripped through a 33-storey tower block in the southern South Korean city of Ulsan has been brought under control, local media said. Hundreds were earlier evacuated from the building and more than 80 people are in hospital for smoke inhalation. The fire broke out between the 8th and 12th floors of the Samhwan Art Nouveau commercial and residential building, which has about 120 households and shopping units. One eyewitness told Yonhap news agency: "Suddenly, the fire came up. The windows were broken and the living room and bedroom lit up."

(July 24, 2020) Officials from the US and the UK have accused Russia of firing an anti—satellite weapon on July 15th. According to US Space Command, the Defense Department arm that’s responsible for military operations in outer space, it found evidence that Russia conducted a non-destructive test of the new technology. As Time noted, officials have been keeping a close eye on it and its twin (Cosmos 2542) since then, especially after they passed close to a powerful US military reconnaissance satellite called KH-11. He explained that “[a]ctions like this threaten the peaceful use of space and risk causing debris that could pose a threat to satellites and the space systems on which the world depends.” (US accuses Russia of firing anti-satellite weapon in space — Yahoo News) <br>

(January 14, 2020) A Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight crashed shortly after taking off from the Iranian capital Tehran on 8 January, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said evidence suggested an Iranian missile brought down the aircraft by accident. "The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.” (What we know about flight PS752 — BBC) <br>

(May 2016) In 2008, Adee reported that a critical failure in Syrian radar might have been intentionally triggered through a “back door” hidden within a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microprocessor. According to a U.S. defense contractor who spoke on condition of anonymity, a“European chip maker” recently built such microprocessors with remote kill switches for just such purposes. Given the dire consequences associated with such weaknesses, the so-called hardware Trojan issue has received considerable attention from academia, industry, and government over the last decade. ICs that are “infected” by a hardware Trojan may experience changes to their functionality or specification, may leak sensitive information, or may experience degraded or unreliable performance. In general, a Trojan contains two basic parts: trigger and payload [Jin and Makris 2008]. A Trojan trigger is an optional part that monitors various signals and/or a series of events in the circuit. The payload usually taps signals from the original (Trojan-free) circuit and the output of the trigger. Once the trigger detects an expected event or condition, the payload is activated to perform malicious behavior.

(May 30, 2015) Joseph R. Biden III, the former attorney general of Delaware and the elder son of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., died on Saturday in Bethesda, Md. He was 46. The cause was brain cancer, his father said. In 2010, the younger Mr. Biden, known as Beau, had suffered what officials described as a mild stroke. Three years later, he was admitted to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston after what White House officials described at the time as “an episode of disorientation and weakness.” Officials said in 2013 that the doctors in Texas had removed a small lesion from his brain.

(July 19, 2007) Five years later, Barker et al. (Barker et al., 1985) solved a number of technical problems and showed that it was possible to stimulate brain (as well as peripheral nerve) with magnetic stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]), and this could be accomplished with little or no pain. TMS has now come into wide use, and TES is still used for selective purposes. TBC (M Hallett, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Primer — Neuron 55, Cell Press) <br>

(Jul 13, 2003) With June and Jennifer there was the same desire but theirs was a more complex reflection. For them to look in the mirror was often to see their own image dissolve and distort into that of their identical twin. For moments, sometimes hours, they would feel possessed by the other, so profoundly that they felt their personalities switching and their souls merging. It was at the age of 29 (ironically the same age as the very different Bijani twins) that June and Jennifer made their fatal pact. One of them would have to die in order to set the other free. The question was, who would make the sacrifice - or should both? The reaction of June to Jennifer's unexplained death was as I had anticipated; she was of course grief-stricken, wrote poems of deep mourning and felt keenly the loss of the person with whom she had shared her life. 'We were war-weary,' she said. 'It had been a long battle - someone had to break the vicious circle.' Despite the contrast in the two cases, there are haunting parallels. Both cast an eerie illumination over the nature of human identity; of the need for boundaries between individuals, and the price to be paid when one human being is or becomes too closely coupled physically and emotionally with another.
