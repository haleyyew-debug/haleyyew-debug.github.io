(July 15, 2021) Two Pakistani military officials were killed and three wounded when a bomb blew up their vehicle in an area of southwestern Pakistan where separatist insurgents operate, officials said on Thursday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the late Wednesday blast in Pasni, a coastal town in Balochistan province, 126 km east of Gwadar port, but separatists insurgents have claimed similar attacks in the area in the past. China is heavily involved in the development of the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea as part of a $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is itself part of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure project.

(July 15, 2021) The Communist Party of China's 20th party congress is still over a year away but efforts are being steadily stepped up to boost President Xi Jinping's prominence in the party and the centrality of his ideas.

(July 15, 2021) Compared with the second quarter from last year, the country's economy grew 7.9% in the April to June period. That's less than half of the 18.3% year-over-year growth the nation saw during the first quarter of 2021, per the South China Morning Post. On the other hand, retail sales grew faster than expected at 12.1% year-over-year, compared with an 11% estimate by Reuters. (China sees moderate Q2 GDP growth — Axios) <br>

(July 15, 2021) New evidence has surfaced that China may be expanding its nuclear arsenal – much more, and much faster than previously assumed. Experts from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation obtained satellite images showing work underway on the construction of more than 100 new missile silos near Yumen. … One offers that China is reacting to US actions and that Washington should pursue arms control with Beijing – negotiate to get both sides to limit their forces and avoid an arms race. The other interpretation holds that the new discovery means that there is a nuclear dimension to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s promise that China will have “the dominant position” in the world by 2049, and that Washington should double down on deterrence, including by fully modernizing its nuclear arsenal and more. Yet neither negotiating arms control nor strengthening deterrence is a straightforward solution – nor are the two necessarily mutually exclusive. The Chinese nuclear arsenal, like other facets of Chinese power, is going to be an enduring problem for the United States. As Admiral John Aquilino, the new Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, put it during his confirmation hearing earlier this year: “China is a long-term challenge that must be ‘managed’ rather than ‘solved.’” … Anyone with a cursory knowledge of US-China strategic relations is aware that the United States is a major driver of China’s nuclear modernization program. Beijing is concerned by Washington’s nuclear superiority and its improved ability to find and destroy Chinese forces, or to intercept them with missile defenses. To solve that problem, Beijing has been expanding and perfecting its arsenal. … The deterrers, unlike the arms controllers, think that engaging China is pointless. They believe that the latest news makes clear that China seeks nuclear parity with, perhaps even dominance over, the United States, and they argue that Washington should counter with a major nuclear update. … Moreover, Beijing has been increasing its cyber and space power, and it is developing an integrated deterrence posture, notably through its Strategic Support Force. This overview suggests that China poses little risk of nuclear aggression against the United States and that this will remain unchanged in the foreseeable future.

(July 14, 2021) As China seeks to lure Afghanistan’s Taliban into its BRI, rising security concerns and stalled progress on the CPEC in neighboring Pakistan raises doubts about Beijing’s grand plan for Central Asian connectivity. China has recently dangled big-ticket infrastructure projects in recent meetings with representatives of the Taliban, coincident with the militant group’s seizure of ever-greater swathes of territory as US troops withdrawal from the war-torn country.  China’s offer would effectively seek to physically extend the CPEC to landlocked Afghanistan through trade-promoting roads and power supplies. But Beijing’s overture to the Taliban overlooks the hard fact that the CPEC is increasingly dead in the water in Pakistan, with rising indications before today’s blast that both sides have cooled significantly on the ambitious scheme. Earlier this year, the CPEC Authority informed Pakistan’s cabinet that China’s actual investment in 17 completed projects as of 2021 was a mere $13 billion. Another 21 projects worth an estimated $12 billion were still in the implementation process. Another $28 billion worth of projects is on the proverbial drawing board. The budget represented both Pakistan’s contribution and Chinese-related loans, which by any measure won’t be nearly enough to complete CPEC projects now underway, not to mention those on the drawing board or new potential spokes connecting to Afghanistan.

(July 14, 2021) The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said in a statement the blast was caused by mechanical failure resulting from a "leakage of gas," not a militant attack.

(July 14, 2021) The Winter Olympics in Beijing next February was meant to be another opportunity for China to project soft power and show the world how far it has come since it hosted the Summer Games in 2008.

(July 14, 2021) The ministers said this in a statement on Wednesday (July 14) that every government decision will be collectively decided by the Cabinet after taking into account the views of everyone, local media reported.

(July 14, 2021) A dozen draft proposals, which still need to be approved by the bloc's 27 member states and the EU parliament, were announced on Wednesday. The proposals, however, are likely to face months of negotiations. Some of the key proposals include: Tighter emission limits for cars, which are expected to effectively end new petrol and diesel vehicle sales by 2035 ; A tax on aviation fuel, and a 10-year tax holiday for low-carbon alternatives; A so-called carbon border tariff, which would require manufacturers from outside the EU to pay more for importing materials like steel and concrete; More ambitious targets for expanding renewable energy around the bloc; A requirement for countries to more quickly renovate buildings that are not deemed energy efficient. The Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change. <i> Deal not good. </i> (EU unveils sweeping climate change plan — BBC) <br>

Sourcing labor or goods from Xinjiang or other regions connected to the use of forced labor in Xinjiang. Supplying U.S.-origin commodities, software and technology to entities involved in surveillance or forced labor. Aiding in the construction and operation of internment camps or manufacturing facilities that subject minority groups to forced labor. … Elements of at least 20 industries have been identified as using forced labor in Xinjiang, including agriculture, cell phones, cleaning supplies, construction, cotton, electronics, extractives, hair accessories and wigs, food processing factories, footwear, gloves, hospitality services, metallurgical grade silicon, noodles, printing products, renewable energy, stevia, sugar, textiles and toys. <i> The warning is not only limited to Xinjiang. </i> (U.S. warns firms operating in Xinjiang at "high risk" of violating law — Axios) <br>

(July 11, 2021) UEFA's team of Technical Observers at UEFA EURO 2020 have named Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma as their Player of the Tournament. Donnarumma – and Italy – did not concede in the group stage, letting in a goal for the first time in the round of 16 against Austria. That was the first goal they had shipped in more than 1,000 minutes. Performances throughout the tournament – both individually and as part of the team – are considered when choosing the winner. The player's impact on his team's performances, as well as playing with a positive attitude and with RESPECT, are also taken into account.

(June 10, 2021) Their initial research into a solution got the pair into the HAX hardware accelerator, first in Shenzhen to work on a prototype, then in San Francisco to develop the business side. Connections there ultimately led to the Creative Destruction Lab and HATCH startup accelerator at UBC, where they currently reside. Zennea’s device, ZENS, consists of a non-invasive wearable device that attaches below the chin and is controlled wirelessly by a mobile app. It stimulates the tongue as required to keep it from relaxing or falling back and causing snoring and mild OSA. ... “During my internship,” Tori says, “the intern chose the company. I chose Zennea, because I liked chatting with Rachel, and I liked the technology. There was a good vibe that I responded to.” Tori ended up working for Zennea four days a week through the summer, and with another startup the fifth day. “The internship gave me the opportunity to greatly expand my knowledge,” she adds, “and then transition into a full-time position. It was a smooth process, because I felt that I was already part of the team, and the project I had been working on fed nicely into the next one.” “Sometimes the stars align,” concludes Rachel, “and we can bring interns like Tori onboard right away as full-time employees.

(March 18, 2021) A few years ago, Jaime Xie's mother made her a bet. "My mom was like, Jaime, if you get into Parsons, I will get you a Birkin," Xie told Insider, referring to the exclusive Hermès handbag. Xie is the 22-year-old daughter of billionaire Ken Xie, the Asian American billionaire who built the first firewall and VPN. She got into Parsons (and got the Birkin), but she opted against attending, enrolling instead in the close-to-home Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. About a year later, she dropped out to focus on influencing full-time. Now she has just over 300,000 Instagram followers. Now she makes enough money to fund her shopping habits and career as a fashion influencer. On YouTube, Xie began doing unboxing videos — meaning she would unwrap her designer purchases in real time and show them off to the audience. Around the age of 19, she decided to pursue digital content creation full-time, and now gets invited to fashion shows around the world as an influencer.

Instead of sitting back and watching his bank account grow--Juniper Networks (NSDQ:JNPR) acquired NetScreen earlier this year for $4 billion--the 6-foot, 5-inch engineer from China kept working to make his perimeter security tools better, faster and more robust. He added content-scanning functionality and performance capability. And in 2000, he launched Fortinet, Sunnyvale, Calif., to sell the appliance that came about as a result.

(July 12, 2021) "We see China using economic and financial means to increase its political influence everywhere in the world. It's useless moaning about this, we must offer alternatives," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters at a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels.

This is against the flashpoint of Taiwan. The Economist magazine in April described the island as the "most dangerous place on Earth". (Alarmed by threat of Taiwan flare-up, Japan ramps up defence partnerships — Strait Times) <br>

(July 11, 2021) Calls by foreign authorities for access to information that Beijing considers sensitive have prompted a crackdown in China on “illegal securities activities.” The campaign will tighten regulations for companies listing abroad and focus on cross-border transfers of data. If the government follows through, that project will deflate if not crush the international ambitions of China’s most promising companies, since every cutting-edge enterprise in the digital economy is making its money from data. Those losses could be significant: 34 Chinese companies raised $12.4 billion in IPOs on the New York Stock Exchange in the first half of 2021. Many in Beijing would prefer to see those offerings move to Hong Kong. Every company doing business in both jurisdictions could face the choice between obeying US or Chinese law. Complying with US sanctions will expose those operations, their executives and even their families to legal jeopardy in China. (US-China tensions take an ominous legal turn — Asia Times) <br>

(July 11, 2021) But while supporting emissions reductions, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on Friday for better international coordination on carbon-cutting policies to avoid trade frictions. The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) would impose levies on the carbon content of imported goods in an effort to discourage "carbon leakage", which is the transfer of production to countries with less onerous emission restrictions. Critics of the measure worry that it could become another trade barrier without reducing emissions. <i> And there’s the 15% global corporal tax. </i> (G20 recognises carbon pricing as climate change tool for first time — Strait Times) <br>

(July 9, 2021) A B.C. judge has rejected Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's attempt to submit a trove of banking evidence in her legal battle against extradition to the United States on fraud charges. "My decision is that the application is denied," Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said during a case management hearing on Friday. "The HSBC documents will not be admitted." But Canadian government lawyers argued against allowing the HSBC files as evidence, saying the records are more pertinent to an expected criminal case against Meng in the U.S., not the Canadian extradition hearings.

(July 9, 2021) The US-favored Swedish telecom firm will be responsible for developing an end-to-end network across Malaysia in conjunction with the state-owned Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB). China is pushing hard to build neighboring Southeast Asia’s 5G network infrastructure. Indonesia and the Philippines, the region’s two most populated nations, are relying on Chinese telecom companies to help develop their 5G networks. Huawei is also bidding to build Thailand’s 5G infrastructure. Vietnam, which similar to Malaysia also has territorial disputes with China, has also shunned Chinese 5G telecom investments in favor of indigenous counterparts. ... Another major concern about Chinese critical infrastructure investments is Beijing’s controversial national intelligence law, which was hastily passed in 2017 with limited public scrutiny and legislative discussion. Article 7 stipulates “any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work according to law.”Article 14, in turn, makes it clear that “state intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.” Under Article 17, relevant Chinese intelligence and security agencies can commandeer communications equipment and property of specific individuals or organizations, as deemed fit. ... In response to growing concern over Beijing’s grip on its overseas ventures, countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and, most recently, even Brazil have tightened restrictions on Chinese telecommunications investments. The US is now working with countries such as Japan and South Korea, which are now heavily banking on the development of next-generation technology, including 6G network telecom, to counter China’s rising influence.

(July 6, 2021) China’s announcement of new rules for companies looking to raise capital on overseas exchanges puts future deals in jeopardy as Beijing shows more interest in the financial decoupling that America’s China hawks have been pushing, analysts said. Gabriel Wildau, a China analyst for the global advisory firm Teneo, said that the new rules “may make foreign listings more difficult” and that Chinese regulators “have been looking for ways to make Chinese capital markets more attractive for national champion tech companies, even since Alibaba listed in New York”. As many as 36 Chinese companies raised a total of US$12.59 billion in US markets in the first half of this year, the highest amount on record, according to Dealogic. US investors poured billions into Didi’s IPO, leading to the company to increase its offering by 10 per cent to raise US$4.4 billion last week. “Now it’s really China that clearly seems to want to do some financial decoupling … to stop its most promising firms from listing abroad instead of listing at home,” Chorzempa said. Overseas listings of China’s biggest tech firms “means that Chinese retail investors can’t get a share of the companies that run the services they use”, he added. “That’s been a sticking point”.

However, they succeeded in Hong Kong which has led to the latest release of documents. Her lawyers are seeking to have them admitted in Canadian court for the next stage of her extradition hearings, set to take place in August. They argue the information will show that the US record of the case is unreliable. (HSBC documents revealed in Huawei extradition battle — BBC) <br>

(June 7, 2021) Explanations of floral adaptation to diverse pollinator faunas have often invoked visitor-mediated trade-offs in which no intermediate, generalized floral phenotype is optimal for pollination success, i.e. fitness valleys are created. In such cases, plant species are expected to specialize on particular groups of flower visitors. Contrary to this expectation, it is com- monly observed that flowers interact with various groups of visitors, while at the same time maintaining distinct pheno- types among ecotypes, subspecies, or congeners. ... Thus, phenotypic diversification of flowers through convergent evolution of certain trait combinations may have been enhanced not only through adaptive specialization for particular visitors, but also through adaptive generalization for particular visitor com- munities. Explorations of how visitor-mediated trade-offs explain the recurrent patterns of floral phenotypes may help reconcile the long-lasting controversy on the validity of pollination syndromes.

(March 1, 2017) There are several reasons for us to transition out of the Branson site. Buildings of this vintage require ongoing investment to upgrade infrastructure and meet new standards. North York General Hospital does not own the Branson facility. Rather, we lease the facility from the Advent Corporation, a lease that expires in 2019. Given that we do not own this building, and Advent has extensive redevelopment plans for the site, it would not be prudent for us to use public dollars to continue to invest in this building. ... In closing, I would like to assure the members of the communities we serve, and our patients and families that their best health care interests are foremost in our decision-making. We remain committed to providing exceptional health care throughout the transition and will put our patients and families first in everything we do.
