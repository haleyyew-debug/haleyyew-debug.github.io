(June 17, 2021) Some 500 policemen raided the offices of pro-democracy paper Apple Daily, alleging its reports breached a national security law. Police also arrested the editor-in-chief and four other executives at their homes. It also froze HK$18m ($2.3; £1.64) of assets owned by three companies linked to Apple Daily. The paper is owned by Jimmy Lai, who is in jail on a string of charges. Apple Daily is known to be critical of the mainland Chinese leadership. <i> They already did something similar last year. </i> (Hong Kong sends 500 officers in pro-democracy paper raid — BBC) <br>

(June 16, 2021) The arrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed. The Russian president flew into Geneva on Wednesday before being taken by motorcade to the grand villa overlooking Lake Geneva where the summit is taking place. Mr Biden, who arrived in the city on Tuesday, then headed to the villa where the two leaders shook hands. <i> G7, NATO, Euro Cup, playoffs, all happening recently to cancel xenophobic sentiments.

TikTok and Douyin are also part of the tournament, which runs until July 11 across the continent, as Chinese companies look to grow. Interestingly for a tournament where the kick-off times fast become unwatchable for those on Beijing time – only the first two rounds of group stage fixtures start before midnight in China –there is a strong presence of Chinese sponsors. <i> Plus AntChain, the blockchain experts who made the sponsorship dominance possible. </i> (China firms aiming to win big at Euro 2020 – just like Fifa World Cup sponsorships — SCMP) <br>

(April 12, 2021) While CSIS has long engaged with academia and has been advising the  Canadian  public  about  threats  to  our  national security  for many years, the  high  stakes  involved in protecting Canada’s biopharmaceutical and life sciences sectors during the pandemic  led  CSIS  to  take  a  more  visible  and  proactive engagement role than ever before. At the onset of the pandemic, CSIS initiated a Canada-wide outreach and engagement initiative focused on  academia, research institutions, and private sector companies in the biopharmaceutical, life sciences, and data science sectors. <i> Canadians are being too weak when threat actors make advances. </i> Threat actors may try to access valuable information through the four gates: 1) imports and exports; 2) investments; 3) knowledge; and 4) licences. CSIS’s support to the government’s pandemic response efforts included the distribution of unclassified and classified intelligence reports to provide senior decision-makers with up-to-date situational awareness and to alert partners to specific national security threats. ... The  CSIS Act  defines foreign influence activities that are “detrimental to the interests of Canada and are clandestine or deceptive, or involve a threat to any person.” These activities are also commonly referred to as  foreign  interference,  and  are  almost  always  conducted  to further the interests of a foreign country using both state and non-state entities, including state proxies and co-optees. In  2020,  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  Russia,  and  other foreign states  continued to  covertly  gather political,  economic, and military  information in Canada  through targeted  threat activities in support of their own state development goals. <i> They dislike being singled out. </i> In many cases, these clandestine influence operations are meant to support foreign political agendas or to deceptively influence Government of Canada policies, officials, or democratic processes. An example of significant concern are activities by threat actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China that seek to leverage and exploit critical freedoms that are otherwise protected  by Canadian society and the Government in order to further the political interests of the Communist Party of China. Foreign  powers  have  attempted  to  covertly  monitor  and intimidate various Canadian communities in order to fulfil their  strategic  and  economic  objectives.  When  engaging  in such activities, foreign states target members of vulnerable communities and groups who often lack the means to protect themselves. These communities often fear state-backed or state-linked retribution targeting both themselves and possibly their loved ones in Canada and abroad. When community groups in Canada are subjected to such harassment, manipulation, or intimidation by foreign states that are either seeking to gather support or mute criticism of their policies, these activities constitute a threat to Canada’s sovereignty and to the safety of Canadians. <i> Gangster policies advanced. </i> ... Certain states may seek to manipulate and misuse Canada’s electoral system to further their own national interests; others may seek to discredit key facets of Canada’s democratic institutions to reduce public confidence in the democratic system. Throughout 2020, and especially since March, foreign threat actors  — including hostile intelligence services and those working on their behalf — have sought to exploit the social and economic conditions created by the pandemic to gather valuable  political, economic, commercial, academic, scientific, and military information. Moreover, these threat actors engaged in covert, deceptive foreign interference activities to advance their own pre-pandemic strategic interests. Cyber-espionage, cyber-sabotage, cyber-foreign influence and cyber-terrorism pose significant threats to Canada’s national security, its interests and its economic stability. State-sponsored cyber threat actors use CNOs to steal intellectual property or trade secrets,  or  to  achieve  geopolitical  objectives  through  the disruption  of  critical  infrastructure  and  vital  services, interference with elections, or to conduct disinformation campaigns. <i> Take advantage by reenacting past Cold War occurrences and claim for historical grounds. </i> Threat actors have also compromised third-party vendor software or equipment in order to conduct cyber-operations against that vendor’s clients. In 2020, a state-sponsored cyber threat actor modified  an update mechanism  for a popular brand  of network  management  software  which  allowed  the actor to gain  covert access to thousands  of government and private sector networks around the world. <i> Probably TCP/IP. </i> These  technologies  and goods can be used to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs and associated delivery vehicles. ... Broadly speaking, IMVE conspiracy theories are often influenced by decentralized online trends and communities of extremist  influencers who interpret  local, national  and international  events  through  a  radical  lens. Politically motivated violent extremism (PMVE) encourages the use of violence to establish new political systems, or new structures and norms within existing systems. CSIS is aware of the serious threat posed by CETs who return from conflict zones. The range of training and operational experience they acquire while abroad and the unique environment to which they have been exposed make CETs an especially dangerous threat to the security of Canada. While al-Qaida-affiliated and aligned groups in Africa as well as the Middle East have generally had a local or regional  focus,  RMVE  inspired  attacks  continue  to  pose  a  threat to Canada. <i> Notice the wording here. </i> Al-Qaida-aligned al-Shabaab  remains  the  dominant  terrorist  group in  the  Horn of Africa and has not been hampered by military  activities by the United States and other foreign partners. In late February 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed an agreement that laid out the conditions for a full withdrawal of Coalition forces from Afghanistan by May 2021. This withdrawal is conditional on the Taliban’s participation in the Afghan Peace Negotiations,  an  end to Taliban attacks  on foreign forces, and the Taliban’s commitment not to cooperate with al-Qaida and other non-Afghan militant groups. Through its  Government  Security  Screening  and  Immigration and  Citizenship  Screening  programs,  CSIS  serves  as  the  first line of defence against violent  extremism, espionage, and other threats to national security. <i> Which means there were a lot of attacks in this sector. </i> Covering key national security priorities, as well as issues such as mental health and coping during a pandemic, social  license,  and  GBA+  initiatives,  CSIS  facilitated  collaboration and information sharing  between CSIS and external  sources of expertise to create an environment of continuous learning, challenge assumptions and unconscious  bias and to support innovation. During the year, CSIS employees participated in class  and  seminar  discussions  in  over  thirty  universities  across eight provinces. Similarly,  following  the tragic Toronto Mosque attack, CSIS engaged with important leaders in the Muslim community and is committed to continuing more proactive engagement. ... In 2020, CSIS has: Implemented and published a new Code of Conduct and related policies designed to integrate a healthy, respectful, and harassment-free workplace, to which all employees must affirm their adherence annually, as a condition of their employment; CSIS  opposes  in  the  strongest  possible  terms  the mistreatment of any individual by a foreign agency. CSIS has continued to engage with key foreign partner agencies during the pandemic to exchange information and obtain security intelligence on threats to Canada and Canadian interests, both domestically and abroad. ... The COVID-19 pandemic has created new vulnerabilities to be exploited by highly-capable state actors seeking to further their  strategic interests  to Canada’s  detriment.  The  online environment,  more  than  ever,  provides  fertile  ground  for radicalization, recruitment and communication by a host of Ideologically- and Religiously-Motivated Violent Extremists. There is ongoing public debate regarding the implications of privacy in the  smart phone era. <i> Recommend everyone to use less smartphone by Democrat law maker. </i> Canada’s legal landscape as it relates to privacy and technology continues to evolve. This directly influences CSIS operations, including the way information is collected and when a warrant must be sought. (CSIS Public Report 2020 — Canadian Security Intelligence Service) <br>

(May 4, 2020) Former Bond girl Britt Ekland is opening up about her marriage to Peter Sellers in a new documentary marking the 40th anniversary of the actor’s death. But the marriage wasn’t a fairy tale. In fact, Ekland said when she re-read her diaries, she saw the repeated use of the Swedish word for “fight.” And she vividly remembered one incident that occurred in Rome after they were harassed by paparazzi. “He just went on and on,” she said. “This continued all night and he took my radio and smashed it. In the end, he called our agent and said, ‘Come and pick her up.’ I knew that this time I could never go back.” The couple called it quits in 1968. Sellers passed away 1980 at age 54 from a massive heart attack. (Former Bond girl Britt Ekland says ex-husband Peter Sellers was ‘a very tormented soul’ in new doc — Fox News) <br>

(January 29, 1964) “It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids, without the knowledge of the individual, certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works.” (Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb) <br>

(February  25,  1956) Vladimir  Ilyich  said:  "Stalin  is  excessively  rude,  and  this  defect,  which  can  be  freely  tolerated  in  our midst  and  in  contacts  among  us  Communists,  becomes  a  defect  which  cannot  be  tolerated  in  one holding  the  position  of  the  Secretary  General.  Because  of  this,  I  propose  that  the  comrades consider  the  method  by  which  Stalin  would  be  removed  from  this  position  and  by  which  another man  would  be  selected  for  it,  a  man,  who  above  all,  would  differ  from  Stalin  in  only  one  quality, namely,  greater  tolerance,  greater  loyalty,  greater  kindness,  and  more  considerate  attitude  toward the  comrades,  a  less  capricious  temper,  etc.". Stalin  originated  the  concept  enemy  of  the  people.  This  term  automatically  rendered  it  unnecessary that  the  ideological  errors  of  a  man  or  men  engaged  in  a  controversy  be  proven;  this  term  made possible  the  usage  of  the  most  cruel  repression,  violating  all  norms  of  revolutionary  legality,  against anyone  who  in  any  way  disagreed  with  Stalin,  against  those  who  were  only  suspected  of  hostile intent,  against  those  who  had  bad  reputations.  This  concept,  enemy  of  the  people,  actually eliminated  the  possibility  of  any  kind  of  ideological  fight  or  the  making  of  one's  views  known  on  this or  that  issue,  even  those  of  a  practical  character.  In  the  main,  and  in  actuality,  the  only  proof  of  guilt used,  against  all  norms  of  current  legal  science,  was  the  confession  of  the  accused  himself,  and, as  subsequent  probing  proved,  confessions  were  acquired  through  physical  pressures  against  the accused... It  was  determined  that  of  the  139  members  and  candidates  of  the  party's  Central  Committee  who were  elected  at  the  17th  congress,  98  persons,  that  is,  70  percent,  were  arrested  and  shot  (mostly in  1937-38). What  is  the  reason  that  mass  repressions  against  activists  increased  more  and  more  after  the  17th party  congress?  It  was  because  at  that  time  Stalin  had  so  elevated  himself  above  the  party  and above  the  nation  that  he  ceased  to  consider  either  the  central  committee  or  the  party. The  majority  of  the  Central  Committee  members  and  candidates  elected  at  the  17th  congress  and arrested  in  1937-38  were  expelled  from  the  party  illegally  through  the  brutal  abuse  of  the  party statute,  because  the  question  of  their  expulsion  was  never  studied  at  the  Central  Committee plenum. "You,  yourself,"  said  Zakovskv,  "will  not  need  to  invent  anything.  The  NKVD  will  prepare  for  you  a ready  outline  for  every  branch  of  the  center;  you  will  have  to  study  it  carefully  and  to  remember  well all  questions  and  answers  which  the  court  might  ask.  Pus  case  will  be  ready  in  4-5  months,  or perhaps  a  half  year.  During  all  this  time  you  will  be  preparing  yourself  so  that  you  will  not compromise  the  investigation  and  yourself.  Your  future  will  depend  on  how  the  trial  goes  and  on  its results.  If  you  begin  to  lie  and  to  testify  falsely,  blame  yourself.  If  you  manage  to  endure  it,  you  will save  your  head  and  we  will  feed  and  clothe  you  at  the  government's  cost  until  your  death." This  is  the  kind  of  vile  things  which  were  then  practiced. We must  state  that  after  the  war  the  situation  became  even  more  complicated.  Stalin  became  even more  capricious,  irritable,  and  brutal;  in  particular  his  suspicion  grew.  His  persecution  mania reached  unbelievable  dimensions.  Many  workers  were  becoming  enemies  before  his  very  eyes. After  the  war  Stalin  separated  himself  from  the  collective  even  more.  Everything  was  decided  by him  alone  without  any  consideration  for  anyone  or  anything. This  unbelievable  suspicion  was  cleverly  taken  advantage  of  by  the  abject  provocateur  and  vile enemy,  Beriya,  who  had  murdered  thousands  of  Communists  and  loyal  Soviet  people. The  willfulness  of  Stalin  showed  itself  not  only  in  decisions  concerning  the  internal  life  of  the country  but  also  in  the  international  relations  of  the  Soviet  Union. The  July  plenum  of  the  Central  Committee  studied  in  detail  the  reasons  for  the  development  of conflict  with  Yugoslavia.  It  was  a  shameful  role  which  Stalin  played  here.  The  "Yugoslav  affair" contained  no  problems  which  could  not  have  been  solved  through  party  discussions  among comrades.  There  was  no  significant  basis  for  the  development  of  this  "affair;"  it  was  completely possible  to  have  prevented  the  rupture  of  relations  with  that  country. Stalin  evidently  had  plans  to  finish  off  the  old  members  of  the  political  bureau.  He  often  stated  that political  bureau  members  should  be  replaced  by  new  ones... We can  assume  that  this  was  also  a  design  for  the  future  annihilation  of  the  old  political  bureau members  and  in  this  way  a  cover  for  all  shameful  acts  of  Stalin,  acts  which  we  are  now  considering. Comrades,  we  must  abolish  the  cult  of  the  individual  decisively,  once  and  for  all;  we  must  draw  the proper  conclusions  concerning  both  ideological-theoretical  and  practical  work. First,  in  a  Bolshevik  manner  to  condemn  and  to  eradicate  the  cult  of  the  individual  as  alien  to Marxism-Leninism  and  not  consonant  with  the  principles  of  party  leadership  and  the  norms  of  party life,  and  to  fight  inexorably  all  attempts  at  bringing  back  this  practice  in  one  form  or  another. Secondly,  to  continue  systematically  and  consistently  the  work  done  by  the  party's  central committee  during  the  last  years,  a  work  characterized  by  minute  observation  in  all  party organizations,  from  the  bottom  to  the  top,  of  the  Leninist  principles  of  party-  leadership, characterized,  above  all,  by  the  main  principle  of  collective  leadership,  characterized  by  the observation  of  the  norms  of  party  life  described  in  the  statutes  of  our  party,  and,  finally, characterized  by-  the  wide  practice  of  criticism  and  self-criticism. Thirdly,  to  restore  completely  the  Leninist  principles  of  Soviet  Socialist  democracy.,  expressed  in the  constitution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  to  fight  willfulness  of  individuals  abusing  their  power.  The  evil caused  by  acts  violating  revolutionary  Socialist  legality  which  have  accumulated  during  a  long  time as  a  result  of  the  negative  influence  of  the  cult  of  the  individual  has  to  be  completely  corrected.

(June 15, 2021) The PBOC, I believe, has intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets, soaking up dollars offered for sale against RMB, and investing the proceeds in US Treasuries. Such investments are hard to trace; the PBOC doesn’t necessarily hold Treasuries through its account at the Federal Reserve, but might buy through accounts in London or other financial centers. There are, however, in China’s money markets, tell-tale traces of intervention. <i> These are all covert interventions. </i> I would be surprised to learn that the US Treasury and the PBOC have worked this out in some kind of tacit policy agreement.

China routinely denies all accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. <i> It’s become pathological. </i> The possibility of China being investigated by an international legal body is complicated by the fact that China is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court (ICC) - putting it outside the court's jurisdiction - and it has veto power over cases taken up by the International Court of Justice. The ICC announced in December it would not pursue a case. <i> Weaponizing law. </i> (China has created a dystopian hellscape in Xinjiang, Amnesty report says — BBC) <br>

(June 10, 2021) Computer networks at JBS were hacked last week, temporarily shutting down some operations in Australia, Canada and the US. The payment was reportedly made using Bitcoin after plants had come back online. That disruption threatened food supplies and risked higher food prices for consumers. Last month, fuel delivery in the south east of the US was crippled for several days after a ransomware attack targeted the Colonial Pipeline. President Biden set off on his first official overseas trip with a warning to Russia that it faces "robust and meaningful" consequences if it engages in "harmful activities". <i> This time we will proceed with legal actions. </i> "The White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals," A White House spokeswoman said last week. <i> So the criminals use machines based off Russia, but are not Russians. </i> (Meat giant JBS pays $11m in ransom to resolve cyber-attack — BBC) <br>

(June 10, 2021) Calgary-based TC Energy said it would work with government agencies "to ensure a safe termination of and exit from'' the partially-built line. The completed segment of pipeline was to cover a 1,179-mile (1,897-kilometer) route from the province of Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska where it would have connected with existing pipelines leading to the coast. <i> If the oil was for exports to intrusive countries, then should stop it. </i> (Canada's TC Energy pulls plug on Keystone XL Pipeline — DW News) <br>

(June 9, 2021) TC Energy and the province said they would look at their options in the wake of the cancellation, but TC Energy said the pipeline extension was officially dead as of Wednesday. Richard Masson, an executive fellow with the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, says the pipeline was viewed as an essential link between supply and market. "We end up in a situation now, where those refineries are still looking to get our oil, and we have fewer ways to get it there," Masson said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics. In a release, Alberta's Opposition NDP called for the premier to release the full contents of the pipeline deal. "Now, his mismanagement and complete incompetence on this file has cost the people of Alberta north of $1 billion." <i> Should not waste time on junk news like this. </i> (Keystone XL is dead, and Albertans are on the hook for $1.3B — CBC) <br>

(June 9, 2021) On Monday, London Police charged a 20-year-old man with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for what they say was a "planned, premeditated act" against a family of five "because of their Muslim faith." The National Council of Canadian Muslims called the incident a terrorist attack on Canadian soil and urged that it be treated as such. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stood in the House of Commons on Tuesday and described it as a "terrorist attack motivated by hatred." His national security adviser Vincent Rigby also called it terrorism in a public speech. <i> That should be the right word. </i> Leah West, an assistant professor of international affairs at Carleton University, told CBC's Power & Politics that proving motivation is key to meeting the threshold for a terrorism charge. To secure a charge, three things are required: the intent to cause death or serious harm, evidence that the act was committed for "a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause" and evidence that the act was committed with the intention of intimidating the public or a segment of the population. <i> These criteria are also accurate. </i> ... "There are very difficult choices that security agencies have to make on a daily basis about what resources they allocate to which individuals and which groups," he told Power & Politics. "Inherently, there's always the risk that somebody is just going to slip through the cracks or there are individuals who just don't show up on the radar." <i> Seems they are controlling the narratives, when they control the media and key parts of technology. </i> ... There are two things Ottawa could do if it wants to make the law more useful to investigators in this space, said Nesbitt. The first, he said, would be to improve law enforcement's capacity to investigate terrorism cases — especially those involving perpetrators who seem to have acted alone and are not tied to established terrorist groups. <i> Not permitted to play with law. </i> (London police are looking at terrorism charges in truck attack.

(June 8, 2021) He said the FBI had provided criminal syndicates in over 100 countries with the devices over the last 18 months “that allowed us to monitor their communications”. “This information led over the last week to hundreds of law enforcement operations on a global scale from New Zealand to Australia to Europe and the USA, with impressive results,” said Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, Deputy Director Operations at Europol. The operation began after global police work in the past two years disrupted two other major encrypted phone networks used by criminals, Encrochat and SkyGlobal. According to unsealed court documents cited by US media outlet Vice, the FBI worked with insiders to develop and distribute AN0M devices through the Phantom Secure network of existing criminal customers, unloading 50 – mostly to Australia – as a “beta test”.

(June 4, 2021) The meeting, chaired by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, will be the first time since the start of the pandemic that all seven ministers will get together in person. <i> Could have been virtual too. </i> President Joe Biden has called for minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. If a company pays taxes somewhere with a lower rate, it would probably have to pay top-up taxes. According to the proposal, the global minimum tax would be levied only on the world's 100 largest and most profitable companies. Britain, Germany and France have welcomed this approach in theory but want to ensure companies such as Amazon — which has lower profit margins than other tech firms — do not escape the net. "All of them, and without exception" must be covered by the new rules, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told news agency Reuters.

(June 4, 2021) Asia Times repeatedly tried to reach Pakistan Interior Minister Shaikh Rasheed on the phone for comment on the issue, but his private secretary said that the official was busy in a meeting and never returned follow-up calls. Beijing’s growing influence over Islamabad, he said, had made things tougher for Uighur immigrants through greater police and security agency surveillance, scrutiny and harassment. “They enter our homes and business places now and then on flimsy excuses and harass our females and children without any justification,” he said. The tide has turned more decisively against the Uighurs since 2015, when Pakistan inked the US$60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a crucial spoke in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. It’s around that time, critics say, that Beijing started influencing more of Islamabad’s decisions on the Uighurs. Authorities have since closed down schools and cultural organizations set up by the Uighur community to educate children in their native language. <i> Lots of ongoing harassments on Pakistani people. </i> (China leans on Pakistan to round up its Uighurs — Asia Times) <br>

(June 3, 2021) Hong Kong police will deploy up to 7,000 officers across the city on Friday to prevent people from commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, in a move to ban the public from assembling, local media reported on Thursday.

(June 2, 2021) The oiler replenishment ship IRIS Kharg caught fire near the Iranian port of Jask in the early hours of Wednesday.

(June 2, 2021) Under Mr Biden's amended order, the Treasury Department will create a list of companies that could face financial penalties for their connection to China's defence and surveillance technology sectors, the people said. Until now, the financial sanctions and selection of targeted companies were tied to a congressionally-mandated Defence Department report. The amended order, which Mr Biden is expected to sign later this week, will change the criteria for blacklisting entities to capture those that operate in the defence or surveillance technology sectors. The Trump order targeted companies owned, controlled or otherwise affiliated with the Chinese military. Mr Biden's position has been just as scrutinised on Wall Street, where Mr Trump's order caused confusion over whether the investment ban applied to an array of companies that might be connected - either as a subsidiary or by carrying a similar name - to those on the blacklist. Amid the confusion, the administration last month pushed back a deadline to halt investments in subsidiaries, even though a ban on the listed parent companies has been in place since November. The White House and Treasury will also clarify that the prohibitions apply to subsidiaries of listed companies only if that subsidiary is itself listed by Treasury, the people said. The previous administration aimed to also capture those companies whose names closely match the listed entities. <i> It doesn’t sound that bad, but it’s actually very serious. </i> (Biden to amend Trump's China blacklist, targeting key industries — Strait Times) <br>

(June 2, 2021) The Market Information Research Foundation (SOMI), which represents more than 64,000 parents from the Netherlands and the rest of the European Union, sent a subpoena to an Amsterdam court on Tuesday. According to the foundation, a number of children have died around the world after being encouraged to take on a number of dangerous challenges. The Blackout Challenge, for example, is alleged to challenge TikTokkers to suffocate each other until they pass out. Even if they do not cause death, Linders said, these "risky games or challenges" could psychologically or physically damage children. <i> Companies having close ties to the government are monetizing from all citizens, and cash are transferred directly to some government sectors. </i> (Dutch parents sue TikTok for €1.4 billion — DW News) <br>

(June 1, 2021) Taiwan could be the only place in the Chinese-speaking world that allows people to legally remember the crackdown, Tsai said, noting that the Chinese Communist Party has banned all events to mark the Tiananmen massacre in Hong Kong and Macau since last year, citing the pandemic. <i> The government have a lot of power to control people, so if you want your voices heard, you have to go along with their protocol. </i> The Tiananmen Square crackdown, also known as the June Fourth Incident, occurred on June 4, 1989 in Beijing, when thousands of student-led demonstrators calling for democracy, free speech and a free press in China were brutally crushed by the military. Estimates of the number of deaths related to the incident range from a few hundred to several thousand due to the lack of concrete proof and records.

(Updated Apr. 26, 2007) The transformation we use is global, namely it (potentially) affects all the procedures in the program by forcing them all to consume an extra receiver as an argument. We usually don’t have a choice as to whether or not to transform a procedure. Suppose f invokes g and g invokes h, and we transform f to f/k but don’t transform g or h. Now when f/k invokes g and g invokes h, suppose h consumes input from the Web. At this point the program terminates, but the last receiver procedure (necessary to resume the computation when the user supplies an input) is the one given to f/k, with all record of g and h erased. Indeed, we would have encountered an error even earlier, when the transformed version of f, namely f/k, tried to invoke g with an extra receiver argument that g was not transformed to accept. In this even simpler way, therefore, the transformation process has a cascading effect. <i> Priority of the transformations are in Canada, Argentina, Japan, according to scheme published in 1991. </i> (Shriram Krishnamurthi, Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation, 2003) <br>

(June 1, 2021) The planned trip comes more than five weeks after ASEAN leaders announced a "five-point consensus" to end violence; promote dialogue; deliver aid; appoint a special envoy; and send a delegation headed by the envoy to Myanmar to meet "with all parties concerned". <i> </i> Erywan Yusof, the second minister for foreign affairs for Brunei, ASEAN's chair this year, and the bloc's secretary-general Lim Jock Hoi, also from Brunei, are scheduled to meet this week with leaders of the junta, among other stakeholders, the sources, who asked not to be identified, said. It is unclear if the pair plan to meet with opponents of the junta, many of whom are imprisoned or in hiding. <i> </i> They said the paper also proposed limiting the envoy's job to mediating, not basing them in Myanmar, giving them a small staff paid for by the home country of the envoy. China watered down a UN Security Council resolution on Myanmar but said the current political situation was “absolutely not what China wants to see”. ASEAN’s divisions also underpinned its rejection of a draft U.N resolution to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar last week, said three sources. <i> </i> There is also conflict among ASEAN states about when to deliver aid to Myanmar, amid fears from some that the early deployment of assistance without any commitment from Myanmar to hold dialogue with its opponents could be exploited by the junta for propaganda purposes, two of the sources said.

The nuclear deal signed in 2015 with the United States, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia only permits Iran only to keep a total stockpile of 202.8 kilograms (447 pounds) of enriched uranium. <i> That’s more than 15 times the permitted number. </i> (Access to key Iranian data lacking since Feb 23 — Fox News) <br>

(May 31, 2021) US-China relations set to deteriorate as Biden gives new life to theory the lethal contagion escaped from a Chinese lab. First, if the lab-leak theory turned out to be true, China would be caught in violation of yet another international agreement it has signed onto. The United Nations’ Biological Weapons Convention prohibits not only the use, but also the development and production of biological weapons. China acceded to the Convention in 1984. The Chinese Communist Party believes maintaining the appearance of a virtuocracy is essential to the regime’s legitimacy. The party leadership is hypersensitive to accusations of dishonorable behavior. Once Beijing has committed itself to a particular position and narrative seen as necessary to save face, backing down is unlikely, even when there is considerable contrary evidence. The Chinese government’s denial of large-scale religious and cultural persecution and mass incarcerations in Xinjiang exemplifies this pattern. When the regime perceives it has been insulted by a foreign government, Beijing is scarcely able to carry on with normal bilateral relations. For example, China embarked on a course that has seriously damaged its relationship with Australia because Canberra called for an international investigation into the origin of the pandemic, a move that offended Beijing.

(May 31, 2021) Raising the ratio forces banks to place more of their forex with the central bank. This decreases their ability to speculate against the Chinese currency; it also means selling renminbi on the offshore market to meet demand for foreign currencies at home. Raising the deposit ratio will put pressure on the supply of U.S. dollars in mainland China’s banking system, said Stephen Chiu, the Asia Forex and Rates Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, noting that the move showed the central bank’s determination to curb short-term rapid appreciation in the yuan. “We will prevent short-term speculative inflows of money from pushing up the yuan and diminishing the competitiveness of export firms,” Sheng said. <i> Nothing new, but educational anyways. </i> (China raises forex reserve ratio for first time since 2007 to damp renminbi rally — Apple Daily) <br>

(November 1850) The principal function of this retainer was to quarrel with the cook; in which respect he was a perfect Whittington, without his cat, or the remotest chance of being made Lord Mayor. He appears to me to have lived in a hail of saucepan-lids. His whole existence was a scuffle. He would shriek for help on the most improper occasions,—as when we had a little dinner-party, or a few friends in the evening,—and would come tumbling out of the kitchen, with iron missiles flying after him. We wanted to get rid of him, but he was very much attached to us, and wouldn’t go. He was a tearful boy, and broke into such deplorable lamentations, when a cessation of our connexion was hinted at, that we were obliged to keep him. He had no mother—no anything in the way of a relative, that I could discover, except a sister, who fled to America the moment we had taken him off her hands; and he became quartered on us like a horrible young changeling. He had a lively perception of his own unfortunate state, and was always rubbing his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket, or stooping to blow his nose on the extreme corner of a little pocket-handkerchief, which he never would take completely out of his pocket, but always economized and secreted. <i> This explains why Chinese are persecuted in the UK, and why there was a second Opium Wat. </i> ... Dora put his nose to mine, and said ‘Boh!’ to drive my seriousness away; but, not succeeding, ordered him into his Pagoda, and sat looking at me, with her hands folded, and a most resigned little expression of countenance.

(May 29, 2021) Ethiopia’s recent decision to open its telecoms market saw a Chinese-backed bid for a mobile licence lose out to a consortium that had US support, but the east African country is likely to remain an important market for Chinese companies. Last weekend, a consortium backed by the US International Development Finance Corporation and UK sovereign investment fund CDC Group and led by Britain’s Vodafone, Kenya’s Safaricom, South Africa’s Vodacom and Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation won the deal after bidding US$850 million to secure a 15-year licence in Africa’s second biggest country.

(May 29, 2021) Between 1999 and 2008, Pakistan received a total of $23 billion in loans and grants from the IMF and other international agencies. From 2008 to 2013, Pakistan received another $ 14 billion, including a $ 7.6 billion IMF bailout package. Some analysts assert that Pakistan might shy from reopening to the US to avoid alienating China, which has committed to investing as much as $60 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructure-building scheme. But that may not be the hurdle some perceive. Ever since coming into power, the incumbent Imran Khan government has taken a lackluster approach to the CPEC. In fact, soon after coming to power in 2018, his government has found loopholes to stall the CPEC and expressed intentions to “review” it.

(May 28, 2021) New census numbers show the foreign population has increased in the past decade, but not by much. The 845,697 of us foreign residents still make up less than 0.1 per cent of the total population, with foreign communities in “international hubs” such as Shanghai and Beijing making up less than 1 per cent of their populations. By comparison, the foreign populations of Seoul (2.8 per cent), Tokyo (4.2 per cent), New York (23 per cent) and London (37 per cent) show how far China’s internationalisation still has to go.

The efforts are getting a boost from Chinese state-run media. "The CCP is masterful at rewriting history and we’re watching them do it in real time," Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter, told Axios. Chinese authorities are pushing the following talking points: 1. The coronavirus may not have originated in China. 2. China's response bought time for the rest of the world. If the U.S. government bungles the response, it will be easier to believe that China actually got it right. (Beijing's coronavirus propaganda blitz goes global — Axios) <br>

(May 25, 2021) A camera system that uses AI and facial recognition intended to reveal states of emotion has been tested on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the BBC has been told. He provided evidence of how the AI system is trained to detect and analyse even minute changes in facial expressions and skin pores. According to his claims, the software creates a pie chart, with the red segment representing a negative or anxious state of mind. <i> Possibly also referring to the attack on private properties, where they use the hacked sensors to generate charts that measures someone’s emotional state. </i> "Uyghur life is now about generating data," he said. The group has also found a document which appears to suggest the firm was developing technology for a so-called One Person, One File system. "For each person the government would store their personal information, their political activities, relationships... anything that might give you insight into how that person would behave and what kind of a threat they might pose," said IPVM's Conor Healy. <i> The study is not only observational, it is experimental.

(May 24, 2021) The Chinese government has developed a sophisticated set of disinformation tools that it is deploying inside liberal democracies. Broadly speaking, the messaging promoted by Beijing-linked actors suggested that democracy had failed in Taiwan, while using false coronavirus claims in an attempt to disrupt political processes and degrade social trust. The researchers analyzed thousands of posts to determine their origin, purpose, effect, audience, and how the disinformation was disseminated. They categorized Beijing's efforts into four types of "attack modes:" Propaganda mode: Distorted information broadcasted by news outlets, either Chinese state media or news outlets that have received hidden financial or other incentives to repackage China's propaganda as legitimate news. Pink mode: Mobilizing Chinese nationalists online to post and amplify disinformation. Content farm mode: Using websites that aggregate low-quality, high-engagement articles to amplify and spread disinformation, often through Facebook, YouTube, and other social media platforms. Collaboration mode: Working closely with real online influencers in the target country to get them to share the desired messages through their platforms. "Taiwan has been flagged as a testing ground for the PRC's worldwide propaganda and information warfare," the report authors write. "China's information operations are profoundly effective in the wars over culture, values, and governance" in Taiwan, the authors wrote, "sowing division in Taiwanese society, pushing groups into echo chambers, and attacking fundamental democratic values."

(May 24, 2021) China’s unilateral construction of roads, settlements and buildings within Bhutan’s territory contradicts the 1998 peace agreement signed by the two countries. That agreement promised to “maintain peace and tranquillity on the Bhutan-China border areas.” What makes matters more complicated for Bhutan is that the area in which Gyalaphug lies is not just ordinary territory. Rather, it is in an area of extraordinary religious significance to the people of Bhutan. In fact, it is speculated that China does not actually need the land it is settling in Bhutan; rather, it aims to coerce the Bhutanese government into surrendering territory in other parts of the country to give China a strategic advantage against India. Gyalaphug now is one of three new villages China has constructed in northern Bhutan. (India must rethink strategy against China’s expansion — Asia Times) <br>

(May 24, 2021) Pope Francis called on believers worldwide to pray for the church in China on Sunday, after celebrating Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica.

(May 24, 2021) A 97-year-old Holocaust survivor received a series of hate-fueled messages on social media during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, her family says, according to reports. But Ebert's great-grandson, Dov Forman, said her pages were recently flooded with hate-fueled messages, including some praising Hitler. "As the violence between Israel and Hamas continues to escalate, we are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate. We are tracking acts of harassment, vandalism, and violence as well as a torrent of online abuse. It’s happening around the world— from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like NYC and in small towns, and across every social media platform," the statement read. The organizations said between May 7 and May 14, more than 17,000 tweets were found that used variations of the phrase, "Hitler was right," according to the news website.

With cuts to the spending plan being in broadband, roads and bridges, demand for iron ore and copper could be curbed.

(May 23, 2021) “The moment you allow the US military bases in the country, China will interpret it as an extension of the US Indo-pacific strategy, which they consider [a] China containment strategy and may roll back the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and withdraw other facilities including soft loans, military cooperation and diplomatic support,” he said. The history of US-Pakistan military cooperation dates back to 1959 when then-military dictator General Ayub Khan allowed US forces to use the Badaber airbase in Peshawar for intelligence-gathering and spying on the erstwhile Soviet Union. These bases gave US forces logistical support for their units in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom from 2001 to 2014. <i> Maybe more bases in Pakistan can provide support to combat terrorism. </i> (Will Pakistan give US post-Afghanistan military bases? — Asia Times) <br>

(May 23, 2021) Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform important cryptographic tasks — essentially getting information from A to B, in a secure manner. The best known example of this is QKD which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem. That encryption would be bonded by physics rather than cryptography — an encryption so strong that the very act of intrusion would break the connection which may instantly be re-established using a new quantum key. Then in May 2019, US President Donald Trump announced that Huawei — along with several other Chinese companies — was now on something called the Entity List.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, General Xu was named Chief of Staff of the army, and he later served as Defense Minister as well. He joined the Communist Party in 1927 and shortly afterward was a leader of the failed Guangzhou uprising. In the late 30's, General Xu set up revolutionary bases to harass Japanese occupation forces, and in the 40's he led troops that inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese Nationalists in the latter stages of the Chinese civil war. Beginning in 1978 he was named Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, and in 1982 he added the title of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

(May 17, 2021) Mining officials say the search has been focusing on possible deposits in Tikus, on southern Sumatra’s tin-rich island of Belitung, in Hatapang in central North Sumatra and in Aceh’s Tigapuluh mountain range. But that may be more for public consumption than anything. Indonesia has everything else needed for lithium batteries: world-leading reserves of nickel — and associated cobalt– in Sulawesi and Maluku, manganese in East Nusa Tenggara, graphite deposits in Southeast Sulawesi, some vanadium in western Java and rare earths in the tin-mining waste of Bangka and Belitung. The largest is Talison Lithium, 240 kilometers south of Perth, a joint venture between Albermarle Corp, a US chemical company, and China’s Tianqi Lithium, which effectively controls 46% of the global production of lithium. The two partners are spending US$1.2 billion on three lithium hydroxide plants due to come on stream in 2021-22. China’s dominant role in the industry worries Washington, which recently announced a $30 million research project to ensure that American business has access to a sustained domestic supply of lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earth minerals. China produces about 170,000 tonnes of lithium and currently controls about 80% of the lithium-ion battery supply chain. But because of its high consumption rate, it also imported large amounts of the material to supplement domestic production. <i> The focus now is not competition, but whether the authorities controlling the industries have malicious intents of weaponizing the products made. </i> Tsingshan is now the world’s largest stainless steel producer, reporting $260 billion in sales and operating a supply chain that incorporates mining and nickel pig iron smelting through to stainless steel smelting and related product manufacturing.

(November 1991) 你说咱长这么大容易吗？ 打在胎里，就随时有可能流产，当妈的一口烟就可能畸形。 长慢了心脏缺损，长快了就六指儿。 好容易扛过十个月生出来了，一不留神，还得让产钳把脑子压扁。 都躲过去了，小儿麻痹、百日咳、猩红热、脑膜炎还在前面等着。 哭起来呛奶，走起来摔跤；摸水水烫，碰火火燎；是个东西撞上，咱就是个半死。 钙多了不长个，钙少了罗圈腿。 总算混到会吃饭能出门了，天上下雹子，地下跑汽车； 大街小巷是个暗处就多个坏人。你说赶谁都是个九死一生。 (王朔, 编辑部的故事) <br>

(October 15, 1940) Victory shall come to the worthy. Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people. No nation can progress with such ideas. They stand in the way of action. Therefore, we totally abolish them. In the future, each man will serve the infest of the state with absolute obedience. Let him who refuses beware! The rights of citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and not-Aryans. They are inferior and therefore enemies of the state. It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.

(May 14, 2021) The U.S. military this week has pulled out of Kandahar Airfield, a sprawling base located outside Afghanistan’s second-largest city, a U.S. official based in Kabul confirms to Fox News.

(May 14, 2021) Japan has unearthed at least 700 Chinese-funded instances of plots of land changing hands near military bases, in a government investigation prompted by security concerns, a newspaper reports. The investments and purchase plans were driven by Chinese-led foreign corporations and could pose a risk to Japan’s safety, the Sankei Shimbun reported Thursday. <i> These guys worship Japan, they are the best students. Cunning tricks are the priority to learn. </i> The Cabinet in Tokyo was due to review a bill controlling land use by foreign investors, and might designate zones within 1 kilometer of key facilities as requiring special attention, Sankei said.

(May 13, 2021) Eric Li, the founding chairperson of Geely Holdings — the parent company of Geely Auto, China’s largest private car manufacturer — invested US$10 billion to help the 94-year-old automaker survive the global financial crisis in 2008. Volvo abandoned its merger plan with Geely Holdings in February, with both companies choosing to maintain their existing independent company structures. But it was apparently not enough to quell Volvo employees’ concerns about having to move its headquarters to mainland China, and even to share its decades-long car-making technology with the Chinese military. Some openly said that they were worried that their designs might have to follow the instructions of the Chinese senior management. With the trend of global containment of China, some Swedish officials have said they are also examining the relationship with China in all areas. Sino-Swedish relations have been at odds in recent years, and Stockholm has accused Beijing of “wantonly” infringing local politics and even influencing public opinion in the country.

(May 13, 2021) "We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel," Mr Musk wrote. "Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment." The dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin. China accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world, according to recent research. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found. (Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin over climate concerns, says Musk — BBC) <br>

(May 12, 2021) The designation, which could have resulted in American investors being forced to divest from Xiaomi, was put on hold in March after a court granted an injunction blocking the move.

(May 12, 2021) Among the 630 cases where it was, at least 304 of the clerics appeared to have been sent to prison, as opposed to the network of "re-education" camps most closely associated with China's mass detention of the Uyghurs. Where information was available from court documents or testimony about the length of the prison sentence, the punishments reflect the harsh nature of Xinjiang justice: 96% sentenced to at least five years and 26% to 20 years or more, including 14 life sentences. <i> Which also explains why people want to free Tibet . </i> According to the arrest notice for Oken Mahmet, a 51-year-old Kazakh imam from Qaba in Xinjiang, Mahmet was charged with "propagating extremism". According to testimony collated by the Xinjiang Victims Database, his family says he was arrested for leading Friday prayers and officiating marriages at a mosque. <i> </i> The official was accused of allowing Ayup's son to visit him at a hospital detention facility after he was arrested. The court document refers to Ayup, who was 88 when he was detained in 2017, as a "religious extremist". Ayup's niece Maryam Muhammad told the BBC the imam was a "kind, hardworking, charitable man, cultured and knowledgeable, who encouraged young people to study not only religion but all the school subjects". Muhammad, who is now in the US, said nearly 60 members of her extended family had been detained since Ayup's arrest, including her husband and all of the imam's eight children. <i> Minute details are often the reason. </i> The real reason imams were being targeted was "because of their ability to bring people together in the community", said Peter Irwin, senior programme officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. <i> Anyone potentially influential is targeted. </i> In the early 2000s, many imams were compelled to attend formalised education courses that foreshadowed the mass "re-education" programmes pursued today against the general population. <i> Possibly for political training. </i> Nurgazy Malik, a father of two, graduate of the official Xinjiang Islamic Institute and editor-in-chief of a state-approved religious magazine, reportedly died in detention in November 2018. <i> More vulnerable if you are within their system. </i> According to Bunin, only 7,714 criminal verdicts are available for Xinjiang for 2018, despite the region logging 74,348 criminal cases that year. The near total absence of verdicts on charges typically levied against religious Uyghurs, like "propagating extremism" and "inciting separatism", suggests China is intentionally scrubbing the record. <i> If people find out about the truth, situations will deteriorate rapidly. </i> (Uyghur imams targeted in China's Xinjiang crackdown — BBC) <br>

(November 1992) Me: What happened to Syra? Syreen: Ah... the death of our world. This subject is very difficult for us, Captain but I will try to recount those sad days. Like your solar system, ours had a large population of comets and asteroids. Large meteor impacts, though rare, were not unheard of on our planet. So it was not a total shock when an asteroid penetrated our atmosphere and hit the surface. What was odd was that unlike most other meteors, this one was not pulverized on impact. It penetrated the crust, and indeed went all the way through to the mantle causing a major caldera... kind of a super volcano. The earthquakes caused by the impact were severe. The magma pumped out of the caldera wreaked significant damage on the nearby terrain but within a few weeks, it had cooled, forming a solid rock bandage over the wound. Within a few months we had cleaned up the mess, the caldera was calming down nicely and things were pretty much back to normal. Then, just over a year after the impact, all hell broke loose on the surface of Syra. Huge calderas were opening all over... not just around the meteor impact, but everywhere! The scope of the disaster is impossible to imagine Entire cities sliding into oceans of molten lava kilometer-wide sections of land being instantly pulverized by cataclysmic explosions and clouds of poison gas and superheated steam creating a death shroud around Syra. Me: What if I told you that Mycon Deep Children shatter planet crusts... like your Syra? Syreen: What?! What did you say?! Human, you had better not be joking. Syra is not a subject for Earth humor. Now what do you mean, shatter planet crusts? How? That IS what happened to Syra, yes, but we presumed it was a natural cataclysm... a meteor. Do you have proof that it was something else... these Deep Children? Me: I don't have proof YET, but I am certain the Mycon destroyed your world. Syreen: Captain, if what you say is true, it would turn my universe upside down. You have no sorrow to match what each of us Syreen feels every day of our lives when we remember what we have lost... Syra... our Eden. The very idea that the Mycon, or any alien race, may have been responsible for Syra's destruction fills me with BURNING RAGE!... then I want to lash out and STRIKE the viewer! It it were true, none of us here would rest until we had avenged ourselves on the perpetrators. We would find some way to leave this starbase, locate our starships, and hunt down the evil monsters! Captain, if you ever gather proof of what you say, you MUST inform us immediately. but until then... do not mention the subject again. It is too painful. (Star Control 2) <br>

(May 12, 2021) This is not, however, an issue of “saying things;” it is a systemic issue. That is, if you don’t have independent media in an independent democratic system, your words simply will not be believed. It is the ability to engage in free and open discussions within your country that lends credibility to your discourse. <i> In fact, if you say something on social media, you get strange hyper waves coming at you rupturing your skin. </i> All of this will impact on three important events in the next few months, each with different necessities for China. The first is the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Communist Party. The second is the Winter Olympics, scheduled for February 2022. There is already the shadow of an international boycott and certainly controversies will grow in the next few months. The third event is the most important and most delicate: the autumn 2022 Party Congress that should keep president Xi Jinping in place and possibly renew the appointments of the rest of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, essentially naming the new batch of people who will rule China for the next decade. <i> More attention is needed on Chinese politics. </i> (China and the superstitions of free speech — Asia Times) <br>

(May 11, 2021) Beijing sees Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to bring the self-ruled island under its control, by force if needed. It has stepped up military intimidation of Taiwan, including by sending warplanes into its air defence identification zone on an almost daily basis since last year, and increased pressure on President Tsai Ing-wen, who has refused to accept the one-China principle.

(May 9, 2021) Reiterating the Taiwan government's consistent depiction of China as the bad actor in the region, the MAC accused China of double-dealing to coerce Taiwan into accepting Beijing's unilaterally imposed outcome for cross-Taiwan Strait relations. <i> The more you read the statements the more you understand what they mean, similar to the case of Uighur genocide. </i> It said Beijing has tried to shift blame for the cross-strait standoff to Taiwan and deliberately created tensions in the region while at the same time continuing its "united front" efforts to win over Taiwanese with economic incentives. <i> The main point here is efforts are deliberate. </i> The united front strategy includes exploring a new integration and developmental path for China and Taiwan and attracting Taiwanese talent, technology, and capital to China through human interactions, emotional ties, and special incentives. <i> I wonder what those special incentives are. </i> These tactics are designed to get Taiwan to submit to Beijing's will, which poses a threat to Taiwan's national security, said the MAC, which described Beijing as the root source of instability in the Taiwan Strait. <i> The strategies and actions were also applied to other countries like the US and Canada. </i> Seeing growing international support for Taiwan and greater attention on China's negative impact on regional security, Beijing recently warned the United States against crossing its "red line" on Taiwan's status, the report said. <i> ‘Make accusations before others accuse you’. </i> (Taiwan depicts China as main source of instability in region — CNA) <br>

(November 1992) No doubt you are familiar with an alien race called the Umgah who live in the Orionis constellation. While they are renowned for their potent and often cruel sense of humor they have outdone themselves in recent years. Specifically, they have used an unusual HyperWave Caster to impersonate the Ilwrath gods, Dogar and Kazon. When the Ilwrath began tuning-in to `the voices of their gods' on their hyperwave receivers their priest caste was understandably skeptical and counselled their many followers to ignore the blasphemous signals. However, in a surprise move, the majority of the Ilwrath then rose up and slaughtered the entire priest caste. Their reasons for this ghastly move included over-taxation, lack of `quality death in ceremony' and the general feeling that the priests had made Dogar and Kazon's pronouncements overly complex.

(November 1992) Suddenly, the Utwig were stunned by a collective realization! All immediately and urgently donned veils of every description! Hides, leaves, shells, rocks even living drells were donned in the early days. You see, the face is the mechanism that expresses many of the primitive qualities that hinder sentience. Now rid of constant reminders of greed, rage, hatred, and lust the wisdom of the Utwig was no longer hampered by constant reminders of the primitive urge. Over many generations mask etiquette was refined to a rock-solid foundation of our society. Sure, the Morality Riots were expensive both in lives and infrastructure but the result was better mask regulation; specification from your basic Mask of Gruelling but Neccessary Activity to the most highly decorated Countenance of Stellar Representation. These were clearly defined. Recognizing the importance of flexibility, clear-cut and efficient procedures for revision and redesign dealt with the few anomalies. From that moment when we covered the source of our intellectual oppression we knew that it was a grand purpose that defined our destiny. (Star Control 2) <br>

The analysis also showed that on a per-capita basis, China's 2019 emissions were close to the OECD average. The firm expects that the final 2020 data will show China's per-capita emissions exceeded the OECD average. Rhodium's Larsen notes China's per-capita rise stems from higher living standards, China's relatively fossil-intensive power mix and its export-focused manufacturing.

(May 6, 2021) In a nutshell, the US’ nuclear tactical capability has been significantly downsized or nearly eliminated, even while China has built a significant arsenal of missiles and aircraft that can deliver nuclear weapons. In the Northern and Eastern Pacific, the US does not have any tactical nuclear capability. Even in Guam there are no aircraft that could be launched to hit targets in North Korea or China using nuclear weapons. <i> This is a biased article, with less of good intentions. </i> (The case for restoring US nukes in East Asia — Asia Times) <br>

(November 1992) The creatures presently fighting the Ur-Quan are called the Kohr-Ah. They are an Ur-Quan sub-species that split off from the main species many thousands of years ago. Their present fight is a ritual reenactment of a major difference of opinion between rival Ur-Quan leaders after the Ur-Quan overwhelmed their slave-masters, the Dnyarri. The Kohr-Ah are immune to reason, having long ago lost the ability to see their situation objectively. They live in a self-maintained paradox: to ensure their safety and security the Kohr-Ah fight an endless battle against all other sentient species. (Star Control 2) <br>

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, through which about $3 trillion worth of ship borne trade passes each year, despite a 2016 ruling by an arbitration tribunal in The Hague that Beijing's claim was inconsistent with international law. While Duterte still considers China as "a good friend", the Philippine leader last week said: "There are things that are not really subject to a compromise ...

The Taliban, radical Islamists who ran Afghanistan and protected Bin Laden, refused to hand him over. So, a month after 9/11, the US launched air strikes against Afghanistan. <i> Who was funding them? They couldn’t have done it alone. </i> ... The Taliban's spokesman said America's delay in the withdrawal timetable broke the terms of the agreement and meant militants were no longer bound by an undertaking not to attack foreign forces. <i> This message must have been relayed from another party. </i> Mr Biden said last month that the withdrawal will be completed by 11 September - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
