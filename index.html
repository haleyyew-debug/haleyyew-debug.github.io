(July 11, 2021) The United States on Sunday repeated a warning to China that an attack on Philippine armed forces in the South China Sea would trigger a 1951 U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty. (U.S. repeats warning to China against attack on Philippine forces — Reuters) <br>

(July 11, 2021) Japan is a prominent player in the strategic calculus of the two great powers, the United States and China, with Tokyo effectively acting as Washington's lieutenant in the region as a fellow democracy and security ally. This is against the flashpoint of Taiwan. The Economist magazine in April described the island as the "most dangerous place on Earth". (Alarmed by threat of Taiwan flare-up, Japan ramps up defence partnerships — Strait Times) <br>

(July 11, 2021) Calls by foreign authorities for access to information that Beijing considers sensitive have prompted a crackdown in China on “illegal securities activities.” The campaign will tighten regulations for companies listing abroad and focus on cross-border transfers of data. If the government follows through, that project will deflate if not crush the international ambitions of China’s most promising companies, since every cutting-edge enterprise in the digital economy is making its money from data. Those losses could be significant: 34 Chinese companies raised $12.4 billion in IPOs on the New York Stock Exchange in the first half of 2021. Many in Beijing would prefer to see those offerings move to Hong Kong. Every company doing business in both jurisdictions could face the choice between obeying US or Chinese law. Complying with US sanctions will expose those operations, their executives and even their families to legal jeopardy in China. (US-China tensions take an ominous legal turn — Asia Times) <br>

(July 11, 2021) But while supporting emissions reductions, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on Friday for better international coordination on carbon-cutting policies to avoid trade frictions. The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) would impose levies on the carbon content of imported goods in an effort to discourage "carbon leakage", which is the transfer of production to countries with less onerous emission restrictions. Critics of the measure worry that it could become another trade barrier without reducing emissions. <i> And there’s the 15% global corporal tax. </i> (G20 recognises carbon pricing as climate change tool for first time — Strait Times) <br>

(July 11, 2021) Taiwan's Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said Sunday that radiation levels in Taiwan have been normal over the past month, following international reports of a radioactive leak at a nuclear power plant in China. <i> Need to make sure it does not affect your brain activity to create a false sense of smell. Or hair fallout. Or pimples on face. Or organ failures. </i> (Taiwan unaffected by reported leak at China nuclear power plant: AEC — CNA) <br>

(July 11, 2021) Shops were looted overnight and a section of the M2 highway was closed in Johannesburg on Sunday, as sporadic acts of violence following the jailing of former South African President Jacob Zuma spread to the country's main economic hub. (Violence spreads to South Africa's economic hub in wake of Zuma jailing — Reuters) <br>

(July 11, 2021) While the price to rent a condo in some major cities may have gone down during the pandemic, high sales prices in the housing market appear to be having a ripple effect on single-family rental homes in Ontario. <i> Blame malicious companies like Quadreal. The new condos have a lot of tech problems too affecting residents. </i> (Bidding wars to rent a house? In Ontario, tenants and agents say it's a new reality — CBC) <br>

(July 11, 2021) Deliberations are underway in Iran’s parliament to outlaw the use of international social media platforms and instant messaging services, legislation that threatens to cast the country into cyber-darkness. The pending bill would also criminalize the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and proxy servers now used to bypass internet blocks and bans in a country that enforces one of the most rigorous online censorship regimes in the world. (Iran poised to be plunged into utter cyber-darkness — Asia Times) <br>

(July 10, 2021) Ukraine is banking on economic support from China as the two sides agree to work together on infrastructure, but observers say that cooperation will be limited when it comes to critical projects. (China-Ukraine infrastructure deal a surprise for observers of Beijing, Kyiv and Moscow geopolitics — SCMP) <br>

(July 10, 2021) Rescue workers have recovered more victims of the tower block that collapsed in Surfside, Florida, on 24 June. Eighty-six people have been confirmed dead and 54 others are still thought to be missing. Here is what we know about some of the others who have died, and some of those still missing. <i> Time to make commemorations? </i> (Miami building collapse: What do we know about the victims? — BBC) <br>

(July 10, 2021) Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez appointed a new foreign minister but retained his economy minister in a cabinet reshuffle on Saturday. (Spanish foreign minister goes, economy minister stays in cabinet reshuffle — Reuters) <br>

(July 9, 2021) The Commerce Department added 34 foreign entities to an export blacklist on Friday for "acting contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States," including 23 companies allegedly tied to the Chinese military or implicated in the genocide against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Dozens of companies tied to repression in Xinjiang were blacklisted under the Trump administration, and the Biden administration has continued to use the entity list to push back on the growing assertiveness of the Chinese Communist Party. (U.S. blacklists 23 more Chinese entities over Xinjiang abuses, military ties — Axios) <br>

(July 9, 2021) US President Joe Biden has warned his Russian counterpart that Moscow had to "take action" against cybercriminals, the White House said Friday. It comes after a ransomware attack by the REvil hacking group caused chaos to 1,500 US businesses last weekend. <i> A lot were happening at once last weekend. </i> (Biden tells Putin to act on cybercrime — DW News) <br>

(July 8, 2021) The Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP) was first announced back in April as part of the government's 2021 budget, but the budget bill needed to pass before the program could be launched. The budget estimates the program will cost $595 million. Kelly said the eligibility criteria leave out new businesses that tried to open during the pandemic — or opened just before it hit — and are still struggling. "We're making the same mistakes with this new program as we made with the old programs," he said.

(July 10, 2021) China’s internet regulator moved Saturday toward requiring data-rich tech companies to undergo cybersecurity reviews ahead of any foreign listings, making explicit for the first time a data-security requirement that marred last week’s U.S. initial public offering by Didi Global Inc. Separately, China’s main antitrust regulator on Saturday blocked Tencent Holding Ltd. ’s bid to combine the country’s two biggest game-streaming platforms, its first public intervention to halt a merger in China’s technology sector. <i> They are just copying what the US was doing. </i> (Beijing Blocks Merger, Tightens Data Rules as Post-Didi Crackdown Speeds Up — WSJ) <br>

(July 9, 2021) Swedish Maritime Administration spokesman Carl-Johan Linde said the crash must have occurred "in connection" with the plane’s takeoff.

(July 9, 2021) A B.C. judge has rejected Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's attempt to submit a trove of banking evidence in her legal battle against extradition to the United States on fraud charges. "My decision is that the application is denied," Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said during a case management hearing on Friday. "The HSBC documents will not be admitted." But Canadian government lawyers argued against allowing the HSBC files as evidence, saying the records are more pertinent to an expected criminal case against Meng in the U.S., not the Canadian extradition hearings. (Huawei exec Meng Wanzhou loses bid for key evidence in U.S. extradition battle — CBC) <br>

(July 9, 2021) The US-favored Swedish telecom firm will be responsible for developing an end-to-end network across Malaysia in conjunction with the state-owned Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB). China is pushing hard to build neighboring Southeast Asia’s 5G network infrastructure. Indonesia and the Philippines, the region’s two most populated nations, are relying on Chinese telecom companies to help develop their 5G networks. Huawei is also bidding to build Thailand’s 5G infrastructure. Vietnam, which similar to Malaysia also has territorial disputes with China, has also shunned Chinese 5G telecom investments in favor of indigenous counterparts. ... Another major concern about Chinese critical infrastructure investments is Beijing’s controversial national intelligence law, which was hastily passed in 2017 with limited public scrutiny and legislative discussion. Article 7 stipulates “any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work according to law.”Article 14, in turn, makes it clear that “state intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.” Under Article 17, relevant Chinese intelligence and security agencies can commandeer communications equipment and property of specific individuals or organizations, as deemed fit. ... In response to growing concern over Beijing’s grip on its overseas ventures, countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and, most recently, even Brazil have tightened restrictions on Chinese telecommunications investments. The US is now working with countries such as Japan and South Korea, which are now heavily banking on the development of next-generation technology, including 6G network telecom, to counter China’s rising influence.

(July 8, 2021) The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), set up in its current format in 2014 by President Xi Jinping, implements online censorship, which has tightened dramatically under his tenure.

(July 8, 2021) A judge on Thursday determined that 47 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists will face trial in late September, after prosecutors were granted more time to build a case against them, per Reuters.

(July 6, 2021) China’s announcement of new rules for companies looking to raise capital on overseas exchanges puts future deals in jeopardy as Beijing shows more interest in the financial decoupling that America’s China hawks have been pushing, analysts said. Gabriel Wildau, a China analyst for the global advisory firm Teneo, said that the new rules “may make foreign listings more difficult” and that Chinese regulators “have been looking for ways to make Chinese capital markets more attractive for national champion tech companies, even since Alibaba listed in New York”. As many as 36 Chinese companies raised a total of US$12.59 billion in US markets in the first half of this year, the highest amount on record, according to Dealogic. US investors poured billions into Didi’s IPO, leading to the company to increase its offering by 10 per cent to raise US$4.4 billion last week. “Now it’s really China that clearly seems to want to do some financial decoupling … to stop its most promising firms from listing abroad instead of listing at home,” Chorzempa said. Overseas listings of China’s biggest tech firms “means that Chinese retail investors can’t get a share of the companies that run the services they use”, he added. “That’s been a sticking point”.

They also copied their business models from Silicon Valley companies.

(June 7, 2021) Explanations of floral adaptation to diverse pollinator faunas have often invoked visitor-mediated trade-offs in which no intermediate, generalized floral phenotype is optimal for pollination success, i.e. fitness valleys are created. In such cases, plant species are expected to specialize on particular groups of flower visitors. Contrary to this expectation, it is com- monly observed that flowers interact with various groups of visitors, while at the same time maintaining distinct pheno- types among ecotypes, subspecies, or congeners. ... Thus, phenotypic diversification of flowers through convergent evolution of certain trait combinations may have been enhanced not only through adaptive specialization for particular visitors, but also through adaptive generalization for particular visitor com- munities. Explorations of how visitor-mediated trade-offs explain the recurrent patterns of floral phenotypes may help reconcile the long-lasting controversy on the validity of pollination syndromes.

(March 1, 2017) There are several reasons for us to transition out of the Branson site. Buildings of this vintage require ongoing investment to upgrade infrastructure and meet new standards. North York General Hospital does not own the Branson facility. Rather, we lease the facility from the Advent Corporation, a lease that expires in 2019. Given that we do not own this building, and Advent has extensive redevelopment plans for the site, it would not be prudent for us to use public dollars to continue to invest in this building. ... In closing, I would like to assure the members of the communities we serve, and our patients and families that their best health care interests are foremost in our decision-making. We remain committed to providing exceptional health care throughout the transition and will put our patients and families first in everything we do. (Message to our community on changes at Branson — North York General Hospital) <br>
