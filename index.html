(December 13, 2020) In a further sign that his officials are preparing for no deal, the Sunday Telegraph reported that ministers are drawing up a 10 billion pound (S$18 billion) package to bail out the worst-hit industries. The main opposition Labour Party’s business spokesman Ed Miliband said that Mr Johnson is threatening to “blow up” jobs and livelihoods with his approach to the trade talks.

(December 13, 2020) Neither Chinese President Xi Jinping nor any of the other six members of the Communist Party’s Politburo Standing Committee – it’s top leaders – were present at the service in Nanjing, the eastern city’s modern-day name. Speaking at the service, which was not broadcast live on state television, Chen Xi, the head of the Communist Party’s Organisation Department and a Politburo member, said history should never be forgotten but called for joint efforts with Japan to push forward a healthy and cooperative relationship.

(December 12, 2020) Talks between Britain and the European Union on a post-Brexit trade deal will continue overnight but London believes the current offer from the EU remains unacceptable, a British government source said on Saturday. The two sides have set a deadline of Sunday to find agreement and prevent a chaotic break. (EU's trade deal offer to Britain 'remains unacceptable': UK source — Reuters) <br>

(December 12, 2020) There are concerns about possible skirmishes between British and foreign fishing vessels if no trade deal is reached, with existing transitional rules that give EU boats access to British waters set to expire at the end of the year. The 80-metre-long navy vessels will have the power to stop, check and impound all EU fishing boats operating within Britain’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which can extend 200 miles (320 km) from shore.

(December 12, 2020) Guterres said economic recovery packages launched in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic represented an opportunity to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future - but warned this was not happening fast enough. “We cannot use these resources to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the summit that countries could work together to radically cut dependence on fossil fuels, change agricultural practices, and reverse the process by which for centuries humanity has been quilting the planet in “a toxic teacosy” of greenhouse gases. Diplomats are watching summit speeches for any signs of significantly stronger climate pledges from countries including China, India and Japan.

(December 12, 2020) “The climate scam in reality is just an excuse for greedy renewables investors to carry on ripping off the taxpayer while the poorest and most vulnerable in our communities get shafted” he said. The prime minister said “Australia’s climate and energy policy will be set here in Australia, in Australia’s national interest and not to get a speaking slot at some international summit. The only approval I seek for the policies of my government is the Australian people. That’s it.” Mr Dean said it finally appears that Scott Morrison has learnt perhaps the most valuable lesson about "pandering to the globalist elites.” (Climate ‘scam’ an excuse for 'greedy renewable investors to rip off taxpayers' — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(December 12, 2020) Numerous international figures have condemned his detention. Pence said on Twitter that charges against Lai were “an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere.” Meanwhile, Republican Senator Rick Scott wrote to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam urging her to release Lai and young jailed activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam. “They haven’t committed actual crimes. They’re bravely using their voices to stand for freedom,” he tweeted. (Release Jimmy Lai, says US Vice President Mike Pence — Apple Daily) <br>

(December 12, 2020) President Donald Trump has expressed interest in the appointment of a special counsel tasked with investigating unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter and election fraud in the 2020 presidential race, The Wall Street Journal reported. (Trump wants to appoint special counsel to probe US election fraud and Hunter Biden, report says — Business Insider via SCMP) <br>

(December 12, 2020) Two recent court cases on the production and selling of Bible reading machines have raised fresh concerns over religious freedom in China. Netizens have suggested the stringent control over the distribution of the Bible was because the central government felt threatened by the number of Christians in China, which might have exceeded the number of members in the Communist Party. (Crackdown on Bible distribution in China signals continued religious persecution: reports — Apple Daily) <br>

(December 9, 2020) The price of iron ore – a key raw material in steelmaking – has risen to the highest level since March 2013, according to the China Iron and Steel Association. As the bulk of China’s iron ore supply is imported from Australia and Brazil – Australia supplies about 60 per cent of China’s iron ore – the souring relationship between Beijing and Canberra is adding concerns that bilateral iron ore trade could be disrupted. (China-Australia relations: iron ore price surges amid strong demand and souring ties — SCMP) <br>

(Oct. 14, 2020) On Wednesday, Xi gave the speech in Shenzhen to mark the 40th anniversary of the city’s ­designation as a special economic zone, or SEZ. That event helped turn China into an economic ­powerhouse. The country’s leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, designated the then fishing village as a test bed for international trade and market overhauls. This plan has met with pushback in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy activists view the Greater Bay Area as a way of eroding the city’s distinct culture, way of life and economic value to China, neutralizing its international advantages. (China’s Xi lays out plan to build Shenzhen into global rival to troubled Hong Kong — Washington Post) <br>

(Oct. 23, 1986) Marshal Ye Jianying, a veteran Communist army officer who became one of China's leaders in the late 1970's and the head of state from 1978 to 1983, died yesterday, the New China News Agency reported in Peking. At the peak of his career in 1976 and 1977, when he was the party's deputy chairman, analysts said Marshal Ye's eminence and power had other sources: He was the leading figure in the Military Affairs Commission, the party body overseeing the army, when the army was playing an influential part in political events. He was also the chief political commissar for Guangdong. After Lin Biao, the Defense Minister, died in a purported coup attempt in September 1971, Marshal Ye took his place. The marshal had come to be regarded as an obstacle to Mr. Deng's campaign to root out Maoist influences, which were diminished in late 1982 and early 1983 by the removal of various officers from national and provincial positions. A son, Jianmin, was appointed Governor of Guangdong Province in 1985. (Marshal Ye Jianying dies at 90; had been China's head of state — NY Times) <br>

老者道：“再往上岸走走，好的离那碑记只有里许，有一座灵感大王庙，你不曾见？”行者道：“未见。请公公说说，何为灵感？”那两个老者一齐垂泪道：“老爷啊！那大王：感应一方兴庙宇，威灵千里祐黎民。年年庄上施甘露，岁岁村中落庆云。”行者道：“施甘雨，落庆云，也是好意思，你却这等伤情烦恼，何也？”那老者跌脚捶胸，哏了一声道：“老爷啊！虽则恩多还有怨，纵然慈惠却伤人。只因要吃童男女，不是昭彰正直神。” (西游记 第四十七回) <br>

(December 11, 2020) The US Supreme Court has rejected an unprecedented attempt to throw out election results in four battleground states that was backed by President Donald Trump. But the Supreme Court ruled that Texas did not have legal standing to bring the case, in a brief order rejecting the bid. "Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognisable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections," the court said.

(December 11, 2020) The non-binding 17-4 vote concluded that the vaccine developed by German biotech company BioNTech and its US partner Pfizer is effective safe for use in adults. EU countries are waiting for an approval for vaccines that the bloc's own watchdog said remained on track despite a two-week-long cyberattack.

(December 11, 2020) The bill contains funding for national security, a pay rise for military service members and sets core policy decisions. The annual appropriations bill is seen as a cornerstone of US defence policy: It has passed every year since the 1960s in a bipartisan fashion. Trump is threatening to wield his veto power primarily over a demand that Congress repeal legal protections for technology companies, as the president is locked in a fight with social media giants over alleged bias against conservatives.

(December 11, 2020) Poland, backed by other coal-dependent central European countries, had been holding out for guarantees on funding to pay for a clean energy transition. EU agrees on tougher climate goals for 2030. He said that there were more funds for Poland in the modernization fund, and that the country would craft appropriate legislation to help with the energy transformation process to meet new EU climate goals.

(December 11, 2020) Construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the capacity of natural gas carried from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, has resumed, a spokesman for the company said on Friday. (Construction resumes on Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany — DPA International) <br>

(December 11, 2020) A list of 41 Chinese-owned Australian wineries surfaced online earlier this week, sparking a boycott of their products. Many Australians expressed surprise at the extent of Chinese ownership in the wine industry, and in other economic sectors identified by Australian media. Power supplier Energy Australia has been a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based China Light and Power since 2011, whereas Alinta Energy was sold to Hong Kong conglomerate Chow Tai Fook in 2017. The same year saw Australian manufacturer Ansell sell its condom business to China’s Humanwell Healthcare and CITIC. State-run China Southern Airlines, China’s largest airline, obtained a 100-year lease for Merredin Airport in Western Australia in 1993 for training its aviation manpower. Shandong Landbridge, an infrastructure firm, leased Darwin Port for 99 years in 2015. (Angry Australians call for consumer boycott of Chinese-owned local companies — Apple Daily) <br>

(December 11, 2020) Li praised the “selflessness” displayed by this year’s co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Michael Houghton, and by two of Houghton’s colleagues. Li went on to say: “In today’s world, leaders cannot be self-centered. This would be the largest limitation to innovation.” (‘Leaders can’t be self-centered,’ billionaire Li Ka-shing says — Apple Daily) <br>

(December 10, 2020) The European Commission also proposed that Britain and the EU continue to offer reciprocal access to their fishing waters for up to a year, but London quickly rebuffed the idea. Basic connections by road freight and for road passengers would also continue for six months as long as it was reciprocal. Failure to agree new rules to govern everything from car parts to Camembert would snarl borders, shock financial markets and sow chaos through supply chains in a world already grappling with the economic cost of COVID-19. Johnson portrays Brexit as a chance to give Britain a fully independent, more agile economy. EU powers fear London wants the best of both worlds - preferential access to EU markets but with the advantage to set its own rules. That, they say, would undermine the post-World War Two project that sought to bind the ruined nations of Europe - and particularly Germany and France - into a global trading power. The EU wants Britain to remain tied to the bloc’s labour, social and environmental standards in the future, as well as to state aid rules for corporate state subsidies.

(December 10, 2020) The Aman-2021 drills will involve anti-piracy exercises off the coast of Pakistan in February. The NATO countries involved include the UK, the United States and Turkey, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti.

(December 10, 2020) Taiwan commissioned the first of a new fleet of coastguard ships on Friday, an advanced catamaran that can be armed with missiles during war, as the island bolsters its defences in the face of what it sees as a growing threat from Beijing. With Taiwan’s armed forces dwarfed by China’s, Tsai has championed the concept of “asymmetric warfare”, including adding weapons that are mobile and harder to attack, to make any Chinese offensive costly and difficult. While the United States remains Taiwan’s most important arms supplier, Tsai has also boosted the island’s indigenous defence industry, most notably the planned building of eight submarines. Taiwan’s coastguard is often involved in confrontations with Chinese fishing and sand-dredging ships which Taiwan says operate illegally in its waters. (Taiwan commissions new coast guard ships to bolster defences — Reuters) <br>

(December 9, 2020) The European Union and the United States should work together to stand up to coercive Chinese diplomacy and coordinate with other countries in the region on the disputed South China Sea, the EU ambassador to China said on Thursday. China claims almost the entire South China Sea and warns other countries not to interfere in its dealings with Southeast Asian countries that also claim parts of the waterway and worry about China’s increasingly militarised presence there. (Europe, U.S. should say 'no' to China's 'wolf-warrior' diplomacy - EU envoy — Reuters) <br>

(December 9, 2020) The United States on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Wan Kuok Kai, the leader of China’s 14K Triad organized crime group and a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the U.S. Treasury said. The sanctions also apply to three entities headed by Wan, who is also known as “Broken Tooth,” the agency said in a statement. The Treasury also designated three entities owned or controlled by Wan: Cambodia-based World Hongmen History and Culture Association; Hong Kong-based Dongmei Group; and the Palau China Hung-Mun Cultural Association, based in Palau. It said the World Hongmen group had co-opted elites in Malaysia and Cambodia, continuing a “pattern of overseas Chinese actors trying to paper over illegal criminal activities by framing their actions in terms of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)” and other major initiatives of the CCP.

(December 9, 2020) Fang Fang, a k a Christine Fang, got close to several politicians, especially in the Bay Area, from 2011 to 2015, only to abruptly leave the country as the FBI was closing in. US officials believe China’s Ministry of State Security, its main civilian spy agency, sent her here to collect intelligence and gain influence with up-and-coming politicians. Axios reports Fang had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors; Swalwell won’t say whether he slept with the honeytrap. But then the FBI, in the midst of a counterintelligence probe into Fang’s activities, briefed him in 2015, and he cut all ties. ... Indeed, he’s angrier about the leak than he is about China targeting him. (Eric Swalwell, a Chinese ‘honeytrap’ and FBI double standards — New York Post) <br>

(December 9, 2020) Health Canada announced the approval Wednesday after scientists finished a two-month review of the company's clinical trial data. "The data provided supports favourably the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as well as its safety," the department said in its report authorizing use of the vaccine in Canada for people over the age of 16.

(December 9, 2020) Honda said it was forced to halt production because "transport-related" delays meant a lack of parts. Tim Morris, chief executive of UK Major Ports Group said the pandemic has created an "unprecedented volatility in global supply chains." Honda's Swindon plant, which manufactures the Civic compact family car, is set to close permanently in July of next year. The company cited global changes in the car industry and the need to launch electric vehicles as the main reasons for the closure.

(December 9, 2020) US President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter has said his tax affairs are under investigation. Hunter said he learned of the investigation on Tuesday. He did not disclose any further details about the case. Hunter, 50, was a target of Republican attacks during the 2020 election campaign. (Hunter Biden under investigation over his taxes — BBC) <br>

(December 9, 2020) A case filed directly in the Supreme Court this week by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton contending that state officials in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin unconstitutionally expanded mail-in voting has been hailed as game-changer by the president, who tweeted on Wednesday that it was “the big one” that “everyone has been waiting for.” The Supreme Court so far has shown little interest in getting involved. (The Long-Shot Texas Suit Trump Is Hailing as the ‘Big One’ — Bloomberg) <br>

(October 29, 2020) Shared on Facebook and Instagram days leading up to the 2020 U.S. general election, posts show a clip of Joe Biden saying, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.” Biden’s campaign for months has been ramping up what it calls the largest voter protection program in presidential election history, after Trump repeatedly has suggested without evidence that the election could be “rigged”. Paid for by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the voter hotline Biden mentions is “monitored by DNC employees 24/7/365 who are ready to field questions pertaining to felon disenfranchisement, voter purging, poll worker misconduct, voter machines, accessibility, and more”. (Fact check: Clip of Biden taken out of context to portray him as plotting a voter fraud scheme — Reuters) <br>

(March 19, 2020) “If people would have known about it, it could have been stopped in place,” Trump said. “It could have been stopped right where it came from, China, if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it. But now the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible virus.” China’s top disciplinary body on Thursday blamed Wuhan police for inappropriately reprimanding whistle-blowing doctor Li Wenliang, whose warnings about the virus made him a folk hero. The findings stopped short of recommending disciplinary action against top Wuhan officials as many residents had demanded on social media. At the same, state media have highlighted struggles to contain the disease in the West and Chinese diplomats have lashed out at foreign officials who attempt to blame Beijing for the outbreak. The embassy also shared a tweet, later deleted, calling the Bolsonaro family “poison” for Brazil, which prompted an angry reaction from Brazil Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo. In a statement, Araujo demanded an apology from China. (Trump Says China Could’ve ‘Stopped’ Virus Now Roiling U.S. — Bloomberg) <br>

我并不即此而止，还预备给他们一种对照的机会，将在另外一个作品里，来提到二十年来的内战，使一些首当其冲的农民，性格灵魂被大力所压，失去了原来的质朴，勤俭，和平，正直的型范以后，成了一个什么样子的新东西。他们受横征暴敛以及鸦片烟的毒害，变成了如何穷困与懒惰！我将把这个民族为历史所带走向一个不可知的命运中前进时，一些小人物在变动中的忧患，与由于营养不足所产生的“活下去”以及“怎样活下去”的观念和欲望，来作朴素的叙述。我的读者应是有理性，而这点理性便基于对中国现社会变动有所关心，认识这个民族的过去伟大处与目前堕落处，各在那里很寂寞的从事与民族复兴大业的人。(沈从文, 边城, 1934) <br>

(December 9, 2020) Ethnic Uighurs in China's Xinjiang were "arbitrarily" selected for arrest by a computer program that flagged suspicious behavior, Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote in a report detailing an expansive data collection project. The people were flagged using the IJOP program before officials decided whether to send them to camps, according to HRW. The list suggests that the "vast majority" of people were flagged to authorities for legal behavior, including phone calls to relatives abroad, having no fixed address, switching off their phone repeatedly, or appearing "generally untrustworthy." Beijing said that the heavily guarded centers are educational and vocational institutes and that all who have attended have "graduated" and gone home. Surveillance spending in Xinjiang has surged in recent years, with facial recognition, iris scanners, DNA collection and artificial intelligence put to use across the province.

(December 9, 2020) Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith says he “really hopes” Victoria’s Belt and Road agreement will be vetoed amid the passing of the foreign relations bill, because the state becoming a “death-slave” to China is not in Australia’s national interest in any way. The foreign relations bill – passed on Tuesday - gives the Commonwealth power to block any agreement between Australian states, councils or institutions, and a foreign government. “If state governments want to enter into these sorts of weird and wonderful agreements then they’ve got to check it off with Canberra first.” (Victoria becoming a ‘death slave’ to China not ‘in any way’ in the national interest — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(December 8, 2020) The state of Texas, aiming to help President Donald Trump upend the results of the US election, said on Tuesday it has sued Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin at the Supreme Court, calling changes those states made to election procedures amid the coronavirus pandemic unlawful. The long-shot lawsuit, announced by the Republican attorney general of Texas Ken Paxton, was being filed directly with the Supreme Court rather than with a lower court, as is permitted for certain litigation between states. Texas makes the remarkable request of the Supreme Court to immediately block the four states from using the voting results to appoint presidential electors to the Electoral College.

(December 8, 2020) Mainland China has removed 105 mobile applications, including American travel platform TripAdvisor, to cleanse online stores of apps considered to be tainted with pornography, prostitution, gambling and violence, the authorities say. The affected apps included those that provided live-streaming, ebook or video-sharing services. It is unclear why TripAdvisor, which focuses on providing travel information, has been removed.

(December 8, 2020) US cybersecurity firm FireEye says it has recently been attacked by a "highly sophisticated threat actor", believing the hacking was state-sponsored. "The attacker primarily sought information related to certain government customers," he wrote. "Based on my 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, I've concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities," Mr Mandia said in Saturday's blog, adding that the hack was "different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years". FireEye says its hacking tool chest has been plundered meaning that whoever it was now has a potent collection of new techniques to draw upon. The race is on to get the warnings out there before the hackers take advantage. (US cybersecurity firm FireEye hit by 'state-sponsored' attack — BBC) <br>

(December 8, 2020) Shipments of Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine Coronavac have arrived in Indonesia in preparation for a mass vaccination campaign, with another 1.8m doses due to arrive by January. On paper, one of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the Oxford vaccine, which is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at -20C and Pfizer's vaccine at -70C. The virus situation has for the most part been contained in China - and life is slowly but surely returning to a "new normal". (Sinovac: What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccine? — BBC) <br>

It won't be too many years before they match us, because they're stealing our technology. We have people that are facilitating that." In a recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Ratcliffe wrote, "China Is National Security Threat No. 1." "You should be very concerened, because China is not our friend," Biggs said.

(December 8, 2020) Footage from Tucker Carlson on Fox News showed a Chinese academic telling a room full of people the reason China and the US - between 1992 and 2016 - were able to settle all kinds of issues was because China has people at the “top of America’s core inner circle of power and influence”. “They’re doing all of this in the open, they’re mocking us in the open, they are using our own tactics against us like progressive politics, we are in a trade war with them, they are in grey zone warfare at the moment making moves against us,” Ms Southern said. “This is going to be a waiting game. All China has to do to become the number one superpower in the world is wait, because we are capitulating at every turn.” (Chinese academic admits Beijing had people in US' 'inner circle of power' — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(December 8, 2020) Meanwhile, Beijing has built up the second-largest defense budget in the world. At the moment, NATO's own rhetoric can be best summed up in Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's statement that China "does not share our values, it undermines human rights, it bullies other countries and is increasingly engaging in a systemic competition with us." Nonetheless, Beijing is not seen as an adversary, much less a threat. Beijing will work hard, Fallon said, to prevent the growing cohesion by using the same techniques it has "successfully deployed" in the European Union, for example, to "pull countries into its orbit to prevent these organizations from speaking with one voice." "The Balkans are convenient" for China, she explained, "as we do not have harsh ecological and procurement regulations and have more 'flexible' rule of law." The region is important real estate for Beijing, Milic points out, as it connects the ports China already owns in Greece - to NATO's consternation - to the European Union. In addition, the U.S.'s accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999 continues to serve the interests of those wanting to stoke animosity to NATO.

(December 7, 2020) George Gascón embarked Monday on a plan to reimagine criminal prosecutions in Los Angeles County, announcing sweeping policy changes he’ll make as district attorney that include an end to cash bail, a ban on prosecutors seeking enhanced prison sentences and showing leniency to many low-level offenders. The moves echo steps taken by Gascón in San Francisco. Nearly 10% of all misdemeanor cases presented to Gascón during his time in office in the Bay Area were diverted into pretrial alternative sentencing programs. The strategy was routinely lambasted by police and some community leaders, however, with many blaming the lack of punishment as a driving force behind a historic surge in property crime and car break-ins seen during Gascón’s tenure there. Gascón acknowledged that the changes might seem enormous and asked doubters to trust him. (On first day as L.A. County D.A., George Gascón eliminates bail, remakes sentencing rules — LA Times) <br>

(December 3, 2020) The U.S. government estimates that China’s intellectual-property theft costs America as much as $500 billion a year, or between $4,000 and $6,000 per U.S. household. Huawei and other Chinese firms deny this, but China’s efforts to dominate 5G telecommunications will only increase Beijing’s opportunities to collect intelligence, disrupt communications and threaten user privacy world-wide. We shouldn’t assume that Beijing’s efforts to drag the world back into the dark will fail just because the forces of good have triumphed before in modern times. This generation will be judged by its response to China’s effort to reshape the world in its own image and replace America as the dominant superpower. The intelligence is clear. Our response must be as well. (China Is National Security Threat No. 1 — John Ratcliffe, Wall Street Journal) <br>

(October 21, 2020) China claims the small archipelago as the Xisha Islands, as well as sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where it has built numerous military installations on islands, reefs and shoals. But now, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is numerically the largest in the world, according to a recently released Pentagon report detailing the massive resources Beijing has poured into backing up its foreign policy ambitions with force. According to the report, the PLAN has a battle force of approximately 350 vessels, the majority of which are missile patrol boats, corvettes, frigates and destroyers distributed across northern, eastern and southern theaters along the coast of China. Many of these vessels are "multi-role platforms" equipped with advanced anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine weapons and sensors. The US Navy's battle force numbers approximately 293 ships as of early 2020. The Chinese navy approaches 2 million tons, while the US Navy tops 4.6 million tons, according to a 2019 estimate by the Center for International Maritime Security. And Chinese shipbuilders are working to quickly catch up with the US Navy on tonnage. The Pentagon points out that China is now the "top ship-producing nation in the world by tonnage." The US Navy operates larger vessels, like its 11 aircraft carriers, to project force around the world, and China doesn't necessarily need a blue-water navy right now to deter access to the South China Sea. When Beijing looks out into the Pacific, it sees itself encircled by the so-called first island chain, consisting of the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan and the Philippines. "The PLA is developing the capabilities and operational concepts to conduct offensive operations within the Second Island Chain, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in some cases, globally," it said. But for now, China's greatest naval strength remains close to home. And the Pentagon report indicates that Beijing's capabilities to carry out coordinated operations diminish with distance, with the PLAN's ability to execute missions beyond the first island chain remaining "modest but growing." "I think the conventional wisdom is that the United States will maintain a technological advantage for at least the next two decades," said Poling.

(October 8, 2020) Here, however, we use in-depth analyses of the available data and literature to prove that these novel animal coronaviruses do not exist in nature and their sequences have been fabricated. The fact that data fabrications were used to cover up the true origin of SARS-CoV-2 further implicates that the laboratory modification here is beyond simple gain-of-function research. We therefore define SARS-CoV-2 as an Unrestricted Bioweapon and the current pandemic a result of Unrestricted Biowarfare.

(December 8, 2020) Biegun is scheduled to meet a number of South Korean officials, including the foreign minister; the minister of unification, who handles relations with North Korea; and the country’s nuclear envoy, among other officials. Amid Trump’s unpredictable moves, Biegun won admirers in South Korea, where one former senior diplomat said he clearly has experience in handling complex issues and knows how Washington works. In the end, however, the talks with North Korea championed by Biegun and his counterparts in Seoul have been stalled since late 2019.

(December 7, 2020) Beijing’s action heightened alarm in the West. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group - comprised of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - said last month the move appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics, and called on China to reverse course. The sanctions prohibit the 14 individuals and their immediate members from traveling to the United States. Any assets the officials might have within the United States will be blocked and U.S. individuals and companies will be banned from dealing with them. The news kept global markets on edge as investors fretted over fresh Sino-U.S. tensions, which offset bets over more stimulus in Europe and the United States.

"He can do it with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 He can even maybe use the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917. But we've got to break those connections, because if we don't do that, we are going into a point where we may not be able to deter China," Chang warned, "because they are so arrogant, so belligerent that they think they can buy any American politician, including the president of the United States."

(December 7, 2020) The carmaker, which raised US$1.2 billion in New York in 2018, was valued at almost US$62 billion when its stock soared ninefold to a record US$57.20 in November, worth more than the century-old Ford Motor. Xpeng, listed in New York since August, also surpassed Ford in value last month. The battle for supremacy in China’s new-energy vehicle market began in earnest after Tesla started domestic production of its bestselling Model 3 car in December 2019. In October, Tesla cut the starting price of the Model 3 by 8 per cent to 249,900 yuan, ratcheting up pressure on its Chinese rivals.

(December 7, 2020) Armed groups in Myanmar – including the United Wa State Army and the Arakan Army, which was designated a terrorist organisation this year – are acting as Beijing’s proxies by supplying weapons and providing hideouts to insurgent groups in India’s northeastern states, according to Indian officials with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because of rules for speaking with the media. China’s Foreign Ministry denied claims the country was supporting armed groups against India, saying it does not interfere in the affairs of other countries. The United Wa State Army also denied a role in providing any aid or support to Indian rebel groups on China’s behalf, citing, among other factors, the over 800km (500 miles) between their headquarters and the India-Myanmar border. Both India and China are investing in Myanmar for strategic reasons. Beijing is investing in gas pipelines and roads to link its southern province of Yunnan with the Bay of Bengal, allowing for key imports to bypass the Malacca Strait between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. India, meanwhile, is investing in the US$292 million Kaladan Multimodal project to connect its underdeveloped northeastern states to the Bay of Bengal.

Banks usually would not take the “serious” step of freezing accounts unless there was sufficient and solid evidence, the industry insider added. As a general rule, banks in Hong Kong are required to give 30 days’ notice before closing a client’s account.

(December 7, 2020) The channel would be taken off-air on Friday as scheduled, after the Taipei High Administrative Court on Monday ruled that television station CTiTV had made ungrounded applications in seeking a delayed shutdown and an injunction on the channel’s broadcasting frequency. In response to the decision, the TV station, owned by pro-China snack tycoon and Want Want China chair Tsai Eng-meng, said that it was angry and disappointed. The seven-member commission on Nov. 18 unanimously vetoed CTiTV’s license renewal application, saying that the station had run afoul of regulations multiple times and failed to live up to professional standards.

It attributes the illnesses to "directed" and "pulsed" - rather than "continuous" - energy, implying that the victims' exposure was targeted and deliberate. The report also contains a stark warning about the possibility of future incidents and the US government's ability to detect them or to mount a response. The fact that American government employees reported afflictions not only in Cuba and China but also in Russia and other countries raises questions about how widespread the incidents may be.

(December 5, 2020) As Chuck Schumer said rather infamously, “First we take Georgia, then we take America.” But they don’t mean to take America in a good sense. They mean bring it over to things that the people of Georgia don’t want. You’re not going to like it when they want to take over your farm. “Gee, we own this farm too. We were here also. We own this farm.” Here’s exactly how they will change America forever. The radical Democrats, if they get power, they will immediately abolish the Senate filibuster, allowing them to pass any bill they want and giving them free rein to ram through the most extreme left-wing agenda ever conceived while at the same time, destroying our military through a lack of funding. ... China doesn’t like me too much. They pay us billions and billions. That never happened. Billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they pay it, they devalued their currency. They paid a lot of money. They don’t like me. The happiest people in the world right now are the leaders of China, the second happiest or the leaders of Iran. What we would have done in the next four years, we would have been on a footing like nobody’s ever. And now we’re giving it all away. But China said, “We will not deal with you unless you get rid of the America First policy.” And you know what the Democrats said? They said, “Yes, we will do that.” Can you believe this? ... The left lies, they cheat and they steal. They are ruthless and they are hellbent on getting power and control by any means necessary. They investigate you and they prosecute you. The moment you question them, they try and intimidate you. They call you a poor American. “You’re not a good American. You don’t love our country.” They don’t love our country.

(December 6, 2020) Figures compiled from federal government websites, corporate financial reports, the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer and through access to information requests indicate that Ottawa made $240 billion in payments and transfers to individuals, businesses, organizations and government entities between the beginning of the lockdown on March 13 and Nov. 20. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's financial update on Nov. 30 pegged total government spending on the pandemic at $322.3 billion for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2021. The CBC News analysis has tracked $105.66 billion in federal payments to individuals; $118.37 billion that has gone to businesses, non-profits and charitable organizations; and a further $16.17 billion in transfers to government departments and agencies. The largest single expenditure thus far has been the $81.64 billion spent on the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB), the monthly $2,000 payments that were offered to Canadians who were unable to work during the pandemic, with 8.9 million people — a third of all adults in the country — having received them. But the federal subsidies for businesses and other organizations have been even larger. Those supports include $49.27 billion sent to more than 352,000 enterprises to help defray payroll costs under the Canada emergency wage subsidy (CEWS). Another $31.55 billion of interest-free loans extended to almost 790,000 businesses under the Canada emergency business account. At one point this past summer, Ottawa was providing money to 11,721,827 people via CERB and CEWS — meaning that almost 40 per cent of all Canadian adults were receiving government assistance. But in most cases, the federal government refuses to provide details that may serve to identify who has received these funds — even when it's a business. In some cases, the information has pointed to potential conflicts of interest. CBC News has also uncovered new details about the extent of government support for some publicly traded companies. According to the government's official figures, a total of 380 companies received more than $5 million each in CEWS assistance, while close to 3,500 businesses have received between $1 million and $5 million. Ottawa's PPE-related expenditures, largely made on behalf of the provinces and territories, have also been extensive. At least 35 of the contracted companies appear to be based outside of Canada, and have signed agreements worth a total of $607.7 million. ... "All companies who are applying for contracts and wage subsidies should have to declare who their ultimate, beneficial owners are," said Cohen. "Transparent disclosures so that the government sustains the trust of Canadians in the rollout of these needed funds." Page wonders if someone in government is actually trying to obscure the data, or whether it's just a byproduct of the pressures surrounding the COVID-19 fight. "I hope it's not deliberate," he said.

(December 5, 2020) Scientists hope the samples — possibly weighing just 0.1 grams — from the Ryugu asteroid will provide clues to the origin of life and the formation of the solar system. It is believed that the 4.6 billion-year-old material has remained unchanged since the system around the Earth's sun formed. The probe took more than a year to travel back from the asteroid, which was around 300 million kilometers away from Earth when Hayabusa2 carried out its debris collecting task. The 40-centimeter (16-inch) diameter capsule landed in the sparsely populated Woomera area of Australia. After depositing its samples, the Hayabusa2 probe took a new course to begin another journey, expected to take 10 years one way, to the small asteroid called 1998KY26.

(December 5, 2020) With over 80 million health profiles, China has the largest DNA database in the world, and growing. They have also found ways to obtain the DNA of foreigners, including Americans. For example, in 2015 it was discovered that the PRC hacked Anthem, the second-largest insurance company in the U.S. According to Chang, genetic data gives China the ability to create bioweapons that can target certain groups of people. Furthermore, he said the country’s behavior of collecting the DNA of foreigners while prohibiting Chinese DNA to foreign researchers supports this theory. In 1984 the PRC signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) treaty in 1984 which prohibits them from developing, producing or stockpiling biological or toxin weapons.

The draft order is designed to deter malicious foreign actors from using cloud service providers to quickly and anonymously conduct cyberattacks, according to three people familiar with the order. It would require U.S. cloud service companies, which typically process or host data for third parties, to keep a log of the identities of foreign customers as a matter of course, the people said.

Pompeo said the visa restrictions would apply to those “who have engaged in the use or threat of physical violence, theft and release of private information, espionage, sabotage, or malicious interference in domestic political affairs, academic freedom, personal privacy, or business activity.” He accused China of seeking to “co-opt and coerce” people in the United States and elsewhere to support its “authoritarian narratives and policy preferences” and called on Beijing “to end its use of coercion and intimidation tactics to suppress freedom of expression.” (Pompeo slaps visa restrictions on Chinese accused of quashing dissent — Reuters) <br>

(March 10, 2017) The researchers propose building a 5-ton chemical laser that will be stationed in low-earth orbit as a combat platform capable of destroying satellites in orbit. Given funding by the Chinese military, which is in charge of China’s space program, the satellite-killing laser could be deployed by 2023. According to the article, an anti-satellite attack in space would employ a ground-based radar to identify a target satellite, a special camera to provide precision targeting and a deployable membrane telescope that would focus the laser beam on the target satellite. China’s space program is dual-use — supporting both civilian and military needs. For example, China’s Shenzhou and Tiangong manned spacecraft were used to perform military missions. It is conceivable that China could launch an orbiting laser gun disguised as a scientific module. The Chinese effort could neutralize decades of investment by the United States in its own directed-energy weapons, including lasers, electromagnetic railguns and high-power microwave arms. “And with their prolific network of espionage, it is likely that development is supported by foreign research they have acquired as well,” he said. In light of these threats, the United States should consider changing its long-held policy of not deploying arms in space.

(April  30,  2010) Conservatives  emphasize  an  altogether different  set  of  concerns.  For  them,  the  main disadvantage  of  a  VAT  is  that  it  would  be  a source  of  revenue  to  fund  a  large,  intrusive government. While  sorting  out  cause-and-effect  among  these  international differences  is  hard,  many  conservatives agree  with  Edward  C.  Prescott,  a  Nobel laureate  in  economics  whose  research  suggests  that  Europe’s  lower  income  is  largely attributable  to  its  higher  tax  rates. So  why,  if  these  two  tax  systems  are really  the  same,  are  conservatives  attracted to  the  flat  tax  and  repelled  by  the  VAT?  It is  because  the  flat  tax  is  usually  proposed as  a  substitute  for  our  current  tax  system, whereas  the  VAT  is  often  suggested  as  an addition  to  it.

Nasa will be paying the companies for individual collections of lunar regolith between 50g and 500g in weight. The funding is so low because Nasa is only paying for the collection of the regolith, not any of the companies' development or transport costs, agency officials said. There are expected to be many scientific benefits to the mission, such as allowing firms to practice extracting resources from the lunar surface.

(December 3, 2020) He said US intelligence showed that China had carried out "human testing" on troops with the aim of developing soldiers with "biologically enhanced capabilities". And he said China had engaged in a "massive influence campaign" targeting US members of Congress and their staff by encouraging unions at big firms to tell local politicians to take a softer line on China or face losing union members' votes. "China believes that a global order without it at the top is a historical aberration," he said. "It aims to change that and reverse the spread of liberty around the world."

(December 3, 2020) Mr Newman said during the pandemic, the populace was trained to obediently follow instructions to stay at home and refrain from doing what they needed to do,  from which there's a segue into making sure people continue to do as they're told in regard to the Green New Deal. He added, to pursue the Green New Deal was to pursue policies which would be "extremely expensive and draining" on economic activity.

(December 3, 2020) Malaysia currently has 19 undersea cables, out of over 380 that have been laid worldwide, most of which are funded by Internet and technology giants such as Google and Facebook. Singapore, which has 17 undersea cables in its waters, is considered the de-facto Internet, communications and technology (ICT) hub. Mr Loke said he introduced the exemption upon request by Malaysian broadband service providers in 2019, after finding that there is a lack of Malaysian vessels that had the necessary specification to carry out undersea cable repairs.

The deal would reportedly let Ms Meng return to China from Canada, where she was arrested in 2018.

The act would also require public companies to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who co-authored the bill with Republican Senator John Kennedy, said in a statement that American investors “have been cheated out of their money after investing in seemingly-legitimate Chinese companies that are not held to the same standards as other publicly listed companies.” (Bill forcing Chinese firms to meet U.S. accounting standards passes Congress — Reuters) <br>

(December 2, 2020) Catherine Chow, a history professor of Grinnell College in Iowa, noted that the group posted videos and articles from China Daily, all of which showed the Chinese government denying the existence of a massive surveillance operation targeted at Uighurs.

八戒忍不住口，又对唐僧道：“师父，不要拿过了班儿。常言道：‘留得在，落得怪。’我们且住一个月儿，了了他母子的愿心也罢了，只管忙怎的？”唐僧又咄了一声，喝道。那呆子就自家把嘴打了两下道：“啐！啐！啐！”说道：“莫多话！又做声了！”行者与沙僧赥赥的笑在一边。唐僧又怪行者道：“你笑甚么？”即捻诀要念《紧箍儿咒》，慌得个行者跪下道：“师父，我不曾笑，我不曾笑！千万莫念，莫念！” (西遊記 第九十六回) <br>

(December 2, 2020) The Earth continued to endure a period of significant heating in 2020 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). With data available from January to October this year, the WMO says 2020 is set to be around 1.2C above the baseline, but with a margin of error of 0.1C. "We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year's heat." Overall though the 2020 figure reinforces the view that climate warming, driven by human activities is persisting. The decade from 2011 to 2020 is the warmest yet recorded. As well as record numbers, new evidence suggested that hurricanes get stronger when they hit land because of rising temperatures.

(December 2, 2020) Residents say they can’t go back to their homes since developer China Bloom bought a 99-year lease to take control of Keswick Island in 2019. The Chinese developer has gone as far as banning residents from renting their homes on Airbnb, which residents say has ruined tourism, and blocking them from entering the island from air, land, and sea. Keswick Island, which is owned by the Queensland Government, was declared a national park. (Chinese company buys Australian island, then bans Aussies from living there: report — Fox News) <br>

(December 2, 2020) If further enriched, this quantity could yield more than 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of weapons-grade uranium, enough to build one fission bomb. Iran would require, in total, as little as 5.5 to 6 months to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two nuclear weapons. ... Because of the added difficulties of building an underground site, the completion of a new centrifuge assembly plant able to assemble thousands of advanced centrifuges per year is unlikely in 2021. ... But whether the Islamic Republic will continue down such a path or will instead seek talks ... to have sanctions lifted and frozen money returned in exchange for promises to again suspend its stockpiling remains to be seen.

(December 2, 2020) "I sincerely do not know if we can reach for a deal," Barnier said, according to a transcript of the meeting obtained by DW. The Frenchman said the next 72 hours will be crucial for the fate of the negotiations during a closed-doors meeting of MEPs. The meeting came after some diplomats expressed concern that Barnier's negotiating team might be offering the British government too many compromises. One EU diplomat told Reuters news agency that Barnier should not sign a rushed deal, even if it means a period of trade without an agreement. "There is a worry that because of this pressure of time there is a temptation to rush," the diplomat said after a briefing by negotiator Michel Barnier for the 27 member states' envoys in Brussels.

(December 1, 2020) Just 30 days before Britain leaves the EU’s orbit following a standstill transition period since it formally quit the bloc, the sides are trying to agree a trade deal to avoid a rupture that could snarl almost $1 trillion in annual trade. With each side urging the other to compromise, a French official said Britain must clarify its positions and “really negotiate”, and cautioned that the EU would not accept a “substandard deal”. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said a deal could be done this week, while his deputy, Leo Varadkar, told the Dublin Chamber of Commerce: “We still don’t know what will happen there, but obviously we are all hopeful that we will see an FTA (free trade agreement) concluded in the next couple of weeks.” (No-trade deal Brexit is still possible, UK minister says — Reuters) <br>

(December 1, 2020) After making astronomical discoveries for well over half a century, the radio telescope's 900-ton receiver platform, suspended by cables 450 feet (137 meters) above a 1,000-foot-wide (305 meters) bowl-shaped reflector dish, fell on Tuesday morning. The structure was already looking vulnerable after an auxiliary cable snapped in August, causing a 100-foot gash on the 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish. A main cable then broke in early November, prompting the NSF to announce the structure was beyond repair and would have to be demolished.

(November 30, 2020) The report “Nato 2030”, prepared by a group of so-called “wise persons” and containing 138 proposals, comes amid growing doubts about the purpose and relevance of an alliance branded last year by French President Emmanuel Macron as “brain-dead”. “China is no longer the benign trading partner that the West had hoped for. It is the rising power of our century and Nato must adapt,” said one Nato diplomat who has seen the report, pointing to Chinese activity in the Arctic and Africa and to its heavy investments in European infrastructure.

The US Treasury Department in a statement said the Chinese company supported the leftist government of Maduro in its “efforts to restrict internet service and conduct digital surveillance and cyber operations against political opponents”.

(November 30, 2020) The short-term stimulus package is valued at $70 billion to $100 billion over roughly three years. Freeland said the government will track progress by monitoring such as employment rate, total hours worked and the level of unemployment in the economy to determine when to end the stimulus spending. O'Toole said the government's approach is to add to the national debtload rather than create the conditions that would get people back to work. After some initial stimulus spending, then-prime minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government cut federal spending across the board with a deficit reduction action plan (DRAP) that downsized the budgets of most departments and agencies by five to 10 per cent.

'We want to make a home here, we want to buy our piece of Australia, and China is making it very hard.' Ms Asbury added that it 'feels like Keswick Island has become the property of the Chinese Communist Party'.

那老妖到中堂里叫：“小的们，怎么没了灯光？只莫走了人也？”叫一声，没人答应；又叫一声，又没人答应；及取灯火来看时，只见地下血淋淋的三块肉饼，老王父子及唐僧、八戒俱在，只不见了行者、沙僧。点着火，前后赶看，忽见沙僧还背贴在廊下站哩；被他一把拿住捽倒，照旧捆了。又找寻行者，但见几层门尽皆破损，情知是行者打破走了；也不去追赶，将破门补的补，遮的遮，固守家业不题。 (西遊記 第九十回) <br>
