Officials for the bloc worry that Johnson's Internal Market Bill is yet another manner in which their British counterparts would try to work around complying with the treaty. ... Frost is referring to what is at the core of Brexit: the United Kingdom's complete separation from EU regulation. In the future, UK officials want to distribute government aid to businesses according to the prime minister's wishes — and without interference. The same applies to fishing in waters claimed by Britain. ... This is the week when the decisions will be made. To reach a trade agreement with complicated details at this point in time, both sides would have to make fundamental concessions, cross their own red lines and show flexibility. ... The additional £200 billion (€222 billion/$263 billion) in subsidized wages would cover up the immediate economic consequences of Brexit on January 1, observers say. (DW News) <br>

(November 9, 2020) The peace deal takes effect on Tuesday from 01:00 local time (21:00 GMT Monday). President Putin said the agreement would include an exchange of war prisoners, with "all economical and transport contacts to be un-blocked."

(November 9, 2020) Prospective buyers told Apple Daily that they suspect debt-laden Evergrande may be running low on cash to lend as mortgages. She said such sudden changes of lenders is uncommon, and advised buyers to be cautious with the new arrangement and the potential risks. The original designated vendor, Profit Concept Finance Limited, had offered a maximum of 90% loan of the sale price, and planned to waive interest charges for the first year. The change to ORIX will cost buyers an extra 0.5% to 1% in interest, although that may be offset by the decision to waive a 1% handling fee. (Apple Daily) <br>

(November 9, 2020) China has offered Jamaica loans and expertise to build miles of new highways. Throughout the Caribbean, it has donated security equipment to military and police forces and built a network of Chinese cultural centres. The Caribbean markets are generally small, and most of the nations there lack the sizable reserves of minerals and other raw materials that often draw Chinese attention. China's efforts in the region are part of its global strategy to forge deep economic ties and strong diplomatic relationships around the world, in part through the building of major infrastructure projects under its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. "China's objective is to gradually eliminate the recognition of Taiwan," Bernal said. The total climbs by US$62 billion with the addition of assistance to Venezuela, much of it given in return for long-term oil supplies. In November 2019, the Jamaican government announced that it would stop negotiating new loans from China as part of its effort to reduce debt quickly ... But Jamaican officials say outstanding Chinese loans are not putting an extraordinary burden on the country. The pandemic allowed China to strengthen these relationships further by donating or selling personal protective equipment, in what has come to be called "mask diplomacy." (Strait Times) <br>

(November 20, 2019) The U.S. Congress has been moving to adopt targeted sanctions on Nord Stream 2. The bill sponsored by Senator Cruz is cleverly targeted on pipeline laying vessels which lay pipelines at over 100 feet. Of course, there is always the possibility of a Trump veto, unimaginable as such a move would have been under any prior Republican president. But given that any such veto would anger Republicans such as one of the sanctions bill’s sponsors Senator Cruz, it is unlikely a President under threat of impeachment would want to upset any of the senatorial jurors who have the capacity to convict him.

(November 9, 2020) "The market is taking the Biden win as a positive, as he is not very likely to fight a new trade war with China. The chance for a new tech war is also drifting lower," said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie bank. Bruce Pang, an economist at Hong-Kong based China Renaissance, agreed: "We think the Chinese authorities might be betting on a less confrontational but more predictable Biden administration that they can work with."

(November 8, 2020) According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday. He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. He will end the travel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries. He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children. ... The Biden team said it would ensure all Americans had access to regular and free testing and provide "clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance" to communities. Mr Biden also wants rules mandating the wearing of masks across the country, which he says would save thousands of lives. Mr Biden also announced plans to reboot the virus-hit US economy, which has seen millions more people become unemployed, by boosting manufacturing, investing in infrastructure, making childcare more affordable and reducing the wealth gap between different ethnic groups. He wants measures including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities, fair treatment and pay for workers and enabling the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, which sets monetary policy - to do more to reduce racial wealth disparities. "Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system," his plan says. ... The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement.

(November 8, 2020) Mainland officials may also still hope to draw on the acute conflicts and political uncertainty caused by the presidential election to portray America as a failed democracy in a propaganda campaign, Wu said. They hoped such conflicts and uncertainty would remain so they could continue with the propaganda, Wu said. (Apple Daily) <br>

(November 8, 2020) With up to 80% of Americans expressing uneasiness about China, Biden would unlikely steer the U.S. back to its previous engagement approach, said Kenneth Chan, an associate professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. Biden’s administration would be busy handling COVID-19 and race issues — tasks it sees as the highest priorities — for the first six months. (Apple Daily) <br>

(November 8, 2020) “It might even lead to countries like Japan, Germany and India becoming permanent members at the United Nations Security Council, slowly lessening China’s [attempt at] hegemony at the U.N.,” Wu said. “China has taken advantage of globalization on the one hand, but on the other hand pursued policies under the framework of economic nationalism. The international community finds this unacceptable,” he added. Biden might restart negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a major initiative of the Barack Obama administration that tied free trade to labor and environmental standards — with the goal of isolating China and pressuring the country into opening its markets, said Hung Ho-fung, a political economy professor at John Hopkins University.

"Thank you to the election officials and campaign workers who worked tirelessly to ensure a record number of Americans could cast a ballot and have it counted during such an challenging time for our country." In May, Gates told The Wall Street Journal that he warned President-elect Trump in December 2016 about the risks of a pandemic in the country, urging all of the candidates to make it a national priority. In late April, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it would give an additional $150 million to fight COVID-19, bringing its total contribution to $250 million. Gates also recently laid out a plan on how to reopen the U.S. economy, citing concerns the virus will cost the global economy “tens of trillions of dollars.” (Fox News) <br>

(Sep. 29, 2020) The country is the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for 28% of global emissions, and its move may inspire other countries to follow suit. But observers warn that China faces daunting challenges in reaching its goals. Kicking its coal habit will be particularly hard. ... He says the new targets “won’t likely let us to stop at 1.5° Celsius [of global warming],” the preferred target set in the 2015 Paris agreement. “But below 2° might still be consistent with [Xi’s] announcement.” China has not yet revealed details of how it will do this. But a research group at Tsinghua University presented a $15 trillion, 30-year road map on 27 September that calls for ending the use of coal for electricity generation around 2050, dramatically increasing nuclear and renewable power generation, and relying on electricity for 80% of China’s energy consumption by 2060. ... Last year, the carbon-heavy fuel accounted for about 58% of China’s total energy consumption and 66% of its electricity generation. A recent study by Myllyvirta and colleagues found that China’s coal-fired generating capacity grew by about 40 gigawatts (GW) in 2019, to about 1050 GW. Another 100 GW is under construction and coal interests are lobbying for even more plants. “This is all despite significant overcapacity in the sector,” with plants running at less than 50% of capacity and many coal-power companies losing money, the study said. ... China’s interest in climate change has waned in recent years, due to the slowing down of economic growth and the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement,” (Science) <br>

(November 8, 2020) Outlets projected Biden's win after the state of Pennsylvania, which offers 20 electoral college votes, pushed him over the 270 votes necessary to assume the presidency. ... Biden used his victory speech in Wilmington, Delaware, to announce that he plans to assemble a panel of scientists next week to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Biden vowed to unify, not divide the nation. He also reached out to those who voted for his opponent, Republican Donald Trump: "They are not our enemies. They are Americans." ... Relations between the US and Iran deteriorated under Donald Trump, who pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump, during his term, recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War, and brokered normalization deals between Israel and Gulf states. The Palestinians have been hoping for a chance to hit the reset button on relations with Washington after Abbas ended all political dealings with President Donald Trump's administration, ...

(November 8, 2020) But Biden says he'd drop some of Trump's most aggressive moves against allies, like the steel and aluminum tariffs based on alleged national-security grounds. He has also hinted he might, eventually, try negotiating U.S. re-entry into the pan-Pacific trade pact now known as CPTPP. ... Biden is a staunch NATO advocate, and under his watch, Canada could face a different challenge: conversations about NATO's future role and missions. One major issue continues to hover over the continent: whether Canada will wind up spending billions to install new radar over the Arctic. ... Trump withdrew from the World Health Organization, partially paralyzed the World Trade Organization, part of China-U.S. disputes that touched agriculture, educational exchanges, journalism, new technologies and sanctioned goods. Biden, however, says he wants to approach things differently — for starters, by working more closely with allies. ... Biden has said he would reverse Trump's H1-B visa freeze, review the decision to end humanitarian protection for migrants, repeal Trump's travel ban and increase the number of refugees coming into the U.S. to 125,000. Biden's platform says he also wants to convene a meeting with Canada, Mexico, and other countries in the region to develop an international plan to deal with irregular migration and its root causes.

(November 7, 2020) It's no surprise, then, that his Democratic rival Joe Biden has pledged to restore US manufacturing hegemony and that more products will be "made in all of America." Although the coronavirus pandemic would be his administration's first priority, Biden said he wanted to expand the use of Buy American rules to help boost domestic manufacturing and create millions of new production jobs, including a million in the auto sector. The former vice president's economic plans include a 10% tax on firms who offshore US manufacturing and would eliminate loopholes that help US multinationals to shield their foreign profits from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). "If the Senate remains under Republican control, it is difficult to see Biden getting much done legislatively, including implementing his 'Made in America' plan," Zandi said. "A very high proportion of US-owned manufacturing abroad is producing for sale and use in the country or region where the plant is located," noted economist Ed Lotterman. After all, US multinationals often move production overseas to benefit from new and untapped markets, like Brazil and China. ... Biden plans to enlarge the federal deficit — already at $3.3 trillion (€2.8 trillion), or 16% of GDP — with his huge spending plan worth $5.4 trillion over the next decade. According to his campaign website, joebiden.com, a huge investment to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure will help him meet his target for full employment, while education will account for most of the new public spending. Large tax hikes, mostly on the wealthy, will reverse some of Trump's $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and will offset almost two-thirds of his spending commitments, the rest would benefit from the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, analysts have said. ... Corporate America will pressure Biden to undo many of Trump's aggressive trade policies that, as well as tackling China's economic threat, have weakened ties with the United States' strongest allies, including Mexico and the European Union. But trade experts have said Biden's hands may be tied by his commitment to voters through the Made In America pledge, and that tariffs may remain for some time, despite the huge cost to US importers. "Biden will continue to put pressure on the Chinese to abide by international trade law, but he will not do this through a unilateral trade war," Zandi predicted. "He will reengage with the World Trade Organization and other multilateral trade organizations to put pressure on the Chinese to change their behavior." (DW News) <br>

(November 7, 2020) "Many Africans look at the US elections in a very cynical way — cynical in the sense that they know what stolen elections are all about," Mbembe said. Some Africans have joked on social media that the US is becoming more or less like a post-colonial African state. "Trump's exit leaves us, the African youth, perplexed. We have been observing from a distance, but when this country, which gives a lot of lessons in democracy to African countries, starts to experience this democratic debacle, we wonder whether the world is in peril," Mutombo said. Mbembe hopes that Biden will show more interest than Trump in advancing democracy in the continent.

(November 7, 2020) This is the good news for a world that believes in multilateral arrangements and longs for a reliable America. For people who believe in the good sense of NATO and the Paris climate agreement. For businesspeople, who need reliable regulations for their companies. It was former President Barack Obama who made it clear with his doctrine "Leading from behind," that a large and financial engagement in military matters was expected. Trump built on this strategy shift — and Joe Biden will continue it, albeit in a more diplomatic manner.

(November 7, 2020) Simons himself may not want Democrat Joe Biden in the White House based on some of his campaign promises, but he's keenly aware that the energy sector has more pressing problems than politics. Even if possible impacts from the U.S. election are relatively small, some in the Canadian oilpatch are nervous because the sector is already under severe financial pressure. Biden has vowed to make policy changes that critics argue would be a setback for the oil and gas sector, such as preventing new drilling on federal land in the U.S. and cancelling the presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would help deliver Alberta crude to the U.S.'s Gulf Coast refineries. That's why Biden in the White House would be just one of many uncertainties for Canada's oil industry. (CBC) <br>

(November 6, 2020) President Donald Trump still has a chance of amassing more than 270 electoral college votes and earning a second term, but his campaign is pre-emptively launching bids to challenge state results. In an interview Thursday on MSNBC, Stanford law professor Nathaniel Persily characterized it as a "pre-litigation strategy" as the state results still won't be officially certified for weeks yet. ... On election night, Trump suggested that ballot-counting issues could be dealt with at the U.S. Supreme Court. ... Barr has said in both testimony and interviews this year that he believes mail balloting greatly raises the prospect for fraud. ... Georgia: A Trump campaign lawsuit filed in Chatham County asking a judge to ensure the state laws are being followed on absentee ballots was dismissed Thursday morning. Michigan: The Associated Press projected Michigan's 16 electoral college votes for Biden, with a Trump campaign lawsuit claiming Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, was allowing absentee ballots to be counted without teams of bipartisan observers as well as challengers. Nevada: Trump's campaign said Thursday in Las Vegas that it would file a lawsuit later in the day alleging thousands of people cast ballots who no longer live in the state. The Las Vegas area is the biggest Democratic stronghold in an otherwise predominantly Republican state. Pennsylvania: As with Michigan, Trump surrogates have argued over access in numerous locations while also seeking to intervene in a Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court that deals with whether ballots received up to three days after the election can be counted, deputy campaign manager Justin Clark said. Wisconsin: Trump's campaign also announced that it would ask for a recount in Wisconsin. A recent state law allows for a recount to be triggered by a candidate with a vote margin of less than one per cent. (CBC) <br>

(November 6, 2020) South Korea is still campaigning for its candidate, Yoo Myung-hee, to be named the next director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on November 9. Member nations are due to select the successor to Roberto Azevedo — who stepped down from the WTO's top job at the end of August, a year before his term ended — and the choice has been narrowed down from eight to just two names. The decision to name the next WTO head needs to be approved by consensus, meaning any of the 164 members could block the appointment. The lack of a consensus threatens to render the WTO leaderless at a time when the global economy is facing headwinds from the coronavirus pandemic, increased protectionist tendencies worldwide and the US-China trade conflict, among other things.

(October 20, 2020) When it comes to jobs, debt and housing, Canada’s economic trajectory has split into two, data shows. It’s what economists refer to as a “K-shaped” recovery. On the upper-arm of the K are higher earners, homeowners and older Canadians, as well as companies that can do business remotely or have capitalized on new pandemic-linked trends. On the lower-arm of the K are hourly workers, who are more likely to hold jobs that require face-to-face interaction and be employed in the industries that have been hardest-hit by the lockdown, such as hospitality, retail and entertainment. Young people, whose jobs are often first to be axed in a downturn, are also overrepresented in the bottom half of the K. (Global News) <br>
