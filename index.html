(December 2, 2020) The Earth continued to endure a period of significant heating in 2020 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). With data available from January to October this year, the WMO says 2020 is set to be around 1.2C above the baseline, but with a margin of error of 0.1C. "We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year's heat." Overall though the 2020 figure reinforces the view that climate warming, driven by human activities is persisting. The decade from 2011 to 2020 is the warmest yet recorded. As well as record numbers, new evidence suggested that hurricanes get stronger when they hit land because of rising temperatures.

(December 2, 2020) Residents say they can’t go back to their homes since developer China Bloom bought a 99-year lease to take control of Keswick Island in 2019. The Chinese developer has gone as far as banning residents from renting their homes on Airbnb, which residents say has ruined tourism, and blocking them from entering the island from air, land, and sea. Keswick Island, which is owned by the Queensland Government, was declared a national park. (Chinese company buys Australian island, then bans Aussies from living there: report — Fox News) <br>

(December 2, 2020) If further enriched, this quantity could yield more than 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of weapons-grade uranium, enough to build one fission bomb. Iran would require, in total, as little as 5.5 to 6 months to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two nuclear weapons. ... Because of the added difficulties of building an underground site, the completion of a new centrifuge assembly plant able to assemble thousands of advanced centrifuges per year is unlikely in 2021. ... But whether the Islamic Republic will continue down such a path or will instead seek talks ... to have sanctions lifted and frozen money returned in exchange for promises to again suspend its stockpiling remains to be seen.

(December 2, 2020) "I sincerely do not know if we can reach for a deal," Barnier said, according to a transcript of the meeting obtained by DW. The Frenchman said the next 72 hours will be crucial for the fate of the negotiations during a closed-doors meeting of MEPs. The meeting came after some diplomats expressed concern that Barnier's negotiating team might be offering the British government too many compromises. One EU diplomat told Reuters news agency that Barnier should not sign a rushed deal, even if it means a period of trade without an agreement. "There is a worry that because of this pressure of time there is a temptation to rush," the diplomat said after a briefing by negotiator Michel Barnier for the 27 member states' envoys in Brussels. (Brexit: EU's Barnier unsure on liklihood of reaching a deal — DW News) <br>

(December 1, 2020) Just 30 days before Britain leaves the EU’s orbit following a standstill transition period since it formally quit the bloc, the sides are trying to agree a trade deal to avoid a rupture that could snarl almost $1 trillion in annual trade. With each side urging the other to compromise, a French official said Britain must clarify its positions and “really negotiate”, and cautioned that the EU would not accept a “substandard deal”. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said a deal could be done this week, while his deputy, Leo Varadkar, told the Dublin Chamber of Commerce: “We still don’t know what will happen there, but obviously we are all hopeful that we will see an FTA (free trade agreement) concluded in the next couple of weeks.” (No-trade deal Brexit is still possible, UK minister says — Reuters) <br>

(December 1, 2020) A car drove into a pedestrian zone in the southwestern German city of Trier on Tuesday, killing two people and seriously injuring 15 others, officials said. The city of about 110,000 people is known for its Roman gate, the Porta Nigra, which is near the scene of the crash, and as the birthplace of Karl Marx.

(December 1, 2020) After making astronomical discoveries for well over half a century, the radio telescope's 900-ton receiver platform, suspended by cables 450 feet (137 meters) above a 1,000-foot-wide (305 meters) bowl-shaped reflector dish, fell on Tuesday morning. The structure was already looking vulnerable after an auxiliary cable snapped in August, causing a 100-foot gash on the 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish. A main cable then broke in early November, prompting the NSF to announce the structure was beyond repair and would have to be demolished.

(December 1, 2020) China Coast Guard ship 5402 approached within two nautical miles of the Malaysian oil and gas blocks west of Luconia Shoals on Nov. 19, presumably warning the facilities to stop operations, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said in a report, citing marine traffic data and satellite imagery. The waters off Luconia Shoals saw a standoff between Chinese and Malaysian vessels in 2015. Both countries lay claims to sovereignty of the Luconia Shoals.

(November 30, 2020) The report “Nato 2030”, prepared by a group of so-called “wise persons” and containing 138 proposals, comes amid growing doubts about the purpose and relevance of an alliance branded last year by French President Emmanuel Macron as “brain-dead”. “China is no longer the benign trading partner that the West had hoped for. It is the rising power of our century and Nato must adapt,” said one Nato diplomat who has seen the report, pointing to Chinese activity in the Arctic and Africa and to its heavy investments in European infrastructure. (Nato must focus harder on China’s military rise, urges report — Reuters via SCMP) <br>

(November 30, 2020) The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese firm China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC), accusing it of supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s efforts to undermine democracy. The US Treasury Department in a statement said the Chinese company supported the leftist government of Maduro in its “efforts to restrict internet service and conduct digital surveillance and cyber operations against political opponents”. CEIEC allegedly provided software, training and technical expertise to entities of Venezuela’s government. (US hits Chinese firm CEIEC with sanctions over Venezuela — Reuters via SCMP) <br>

(November 30, 2020) The short-term stimulus package is valued at $70 billion to $100 billion over roughly three years. Freeland said the government will track progress by monitoring such as employment rate, total hours worked and the level of unemployment in the economy to determine when to end the stimulus spending. O'Toole said the government's approach is to add to the national debtload rather than create the conditions that would get people back to work. After some initial stimulus spending, then-prime minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government cut federal spending across the board with a deficit reduction action plan (DRAP) that downsized the budgets of most departments and agencies by five to 10 per cent.

(November 30, 2020) While the breathtaking Whitsundays oasis is 80 per cent national park, the Chinese company controls the remaining 20 per cent and has used its power to padlock all access points to the otherwise government-owned park. She added that the beach, which is a known turtle nesting area, has been overrun with heavy machinery. 'We want to make a home here, we want to buy our piece of Australia, and China is making it very hard.' Ms Asbury added that it 'feels like Keswick Island has become the property of the Chinese Communist Party'.

那老妖到中堂里叫：“小的们，怎么没了灯光？只莫走了人也？”叫一声，没人答应；又叫一声，又没人答应；及取灯火来看时，只见地下血淋淋的三块肉饼，老王父子及唐僧、八戒俱在，只不见了行者、沙僧。点着火，前后赶看，忽见沙僧还背贴在廊下站哩；被他一把拿住捽倒，照旧捆了。又找寻行者，但见几层门尽皆破损，情知是行者打破走了；也不去追赶，将破门补的补，遮的遮，固守家业不题。 (西遊記 第九十回) <br>

(November 30, 2020) The government has not tabled a budget for this fiscal year, but in July delivered what it called a "fiscal snapshot" that projected the deficit would hit a record $343.2 billion. The Trudeau government has pushed back at calls to deliver an economic forecast since the current health crisis began, maintaining that the pandemic made it impossible to accurately predict economic growth or the scope of necessary emergency spending. Federation of Canadian Municipalities president Garth Frizzell said he hopes to see "clear successor arrangements" to the safe restart agreement, which saw the federal government set aside $19 billion for the provinces to help them weather the second wave and drive job growth post-pandemic.

(November 30, 2020) Australia has demanded China apologise for posting a fake picture on a government Twitter account that depicted an Australian soldier murdering an Afghan child. Australia has requested Twitter remove the post from its platform, describing it as "disinformation". Australia has said it will not change its policy positions. On Monday, Mr Morrison confirmed that Australia's requests for meetings with senior Chinese ministers continued to be rebuffed. (Australia demands China apologise for posting 'repugnant' fake image — BBC) <br>

(November 30, 2020) The social media platform — which is banned in China — was scrambling to determine whether Zhao’s use of the image had breached its rules regarding the dissemination of misinformation. However, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times, described the image as a cartoon that condemned Australian special forces for the killings. Morrison’s request for an apology was an “absurd and shameless” move, he said. (China doubles down over incendiary tweet and fake image on Australian war crimes — Apple Daily) <br>

(November 30, 2020) China pledged to enhance its military relationship with Nepal and support its territorial integrity at a time when the small Himayalan neighbour is embroiled in border disputes with India. Wei Fenghe, China’s Defence Minister and State Councillor, made the pledge when he met Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and held talks with the Nepalese Army chief, Purna Chandra Thapa, in Kathmandu on Sunday. (Chinese defence minister declares military support for Nepal against India — SCMP) <br>

(November 30, 2020) “The Chinese military, what they are doing here, they are doing Sun Tzu’s art of war,” Mr Dean said. “They are attacking our army; they have spotted our weakness. They have gone right; we can do two things. We can demoralize the Australian defense forces and at the same time we can delegitimize them in the eyes of the world. This is a purely military strategy to make our army, the most elite and respected SAS in the world, suddenly trash their reputation and demoralize the forces.” (Horrific tweet from China is a military strategy to 'demoralise, deligitimise ADF' — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(November 29, 2020) The move to reform a series of laws governing individual freedoms and social mores comes as the country of nearly 10 million people and a $524-billion economy struggles with a plunge in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic. In the eyes of the state, the aim of the reforms is to boost the country's economic and social standing and "consolidate the U.A.E's principles of tolerance," the state-run Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported. It's a position that could also put the country, which has branded itself as an international destination for work and travel, in good stead as it prepares to attract at least 25 million visitors to the World Expo, to be held for the first time in the Middle East in October 2021. The country has been making a number of social changes in recent years. The sweeping changes mean that individuals no longer have to buy a special licence to purchase or consume alcohol as long as they are 21. "They want to be seen as this model place of pluralism and openness and tolerance, but there's a dark side to the Emirates when you look at how they treat foreign workers," Momani said. Trade unions are illegal in the country, and workers who unionize or strike can be deported. (United Arab Emirates banks on social reform to help pull itself out of economic slump — CBC) <br>

(November 29, 2020) The attackers tied up agricultural labourers working in rice fields and slit their throats near Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, reports say.

(November 29, 2020) Canada has banned the export of some prescription medicines in order to prevent a shortage in the country.

(November 29, 2020) It comes as Australia is preparing to take China to the World Trade Organisation as a tariff dispute over grain escalates. The Morrison government lodged an appeal against the 80 per cent tariffs which were slapped on grain producers, but China upheld its decision, causing Trade Minister Simon Birmingham to say the next step would be to take the dispute to the WTO. Wine exporters have become the latest casualty of the trade stoush between Australia and China and have been hit by tariffs of up to 200 per cent, triggering fears smaller producers will not be able to recover. “Over the weekend, China found yet another reason to punish Australia,” Mr Murray said.

"This sudden change of policy (to take punitive action) appears to show lack of communication among government agencies." Malaysia Employers Federation executive director Shamsuddin Bardan said many employers would "die" faster if the hefty RM50,000 fine were to be imposed for every foreign worker staying in crowded units.

(November 28, 2020) The draft security law, which has already passed the lower house of the French parliament, aims to protect police officers who are occasionally targeted by terrorists or abused on social media. The police were filmed "beating migrants for apparently no reason," said DW's Lisa Louis. "Many people are outraged about how the police are behaving, and they are saying we need to be allowed to film the police in order to protect ourselves," she added. ... Louis added that people of all backgrounds had joined the protests, including members of the press. The proposed bill would make it a crime to publish photos or videos of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their "physical or psychological integrity," which critics say would amount to censorship.

(June 20, 2019) Chinese companies' decisions to hire lobbyists have been driven in part by looking at what’s happened to Huawei and ZTE over the last year. Eight other Chinese companies have spent at least $7.9 million hiring Washington lobbying and public relations firms since last spring, right before Trump cracked down on a different Chinese telecom company, ZTE, according to a POLITICO analysis of disclosure filings. The companies — including a Chinese radio company, a state-owned railcar manufacturer and a maker of surveillance cameras — have hired more than two dozen additional lobbyists over the past year, including former lawmakers and Trump campaign veterans. ZTE has responded by spending millions of dollars on lobbying, including hiring former Sens. Joe Lieberman and Norm Coleman and two lobbyists who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign, David Urban and Bryan Lanza, according to disclosure filings.

哪吒道：“父王忘了。那女儿原是个妖精。三百年前成怪。在灵山偷食了如来的香花宝烛，如来差我父子天兵，将他拿住。拿住时，只该打死。如来吩咐道：‘积水养鱼终不钓，深山喂鹿望长生。’当时饶了他性命。积此恩念，拜父王为父，拜孩儿为兄，在下方供设牌位，侍奉香火。不期他又成精，陷害唐僧，却被孙行者搜寻到巢穴之间，将牌位拿来，就做名告了御状。此是结拜之恩女，非我同袍之亲妹也。”天王闻言，悚然惊讶道：“孩儿，我实忘了。他叫做甚么名字？” (西遊記 第八十三回) <br>

(November 28, 2020) In a brief Friday (Nov 27) statement, the White House said it had sent the nomination to the Senate, where Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo has already signalled that Mr Brooks would get a confirmation hearing for a five-year term leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Mr Brooks has been acting OCC chief since May. Most of the major regulations for US banks are written and approved in collaboration among the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the OCC. Mr Brooks is racing to finish a rule that would prohibit banks from refusing to lend to businesses that carry political risks, such as borrowers tied to oil exploration, firearms and private prisons.

(November 28, 2020) The several changes under consideration include allowing votes cast by people living on the mainland, electronic voting and setting up designated queues for the elderly. The government calls these “enhancements” that will not affect the electoral system’s impartiality. But critics say they will allow more pro-Beijing voters to participate, skewing the results. During her annual Policy Address, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the new arrangements would only be adopted if members of the public are not opposed to them.

(November 28, 2020) Japan is struggling with a mental health crisis as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, with more people dying in one month from suicide than from COVID-19 all year long.

The authorities have given the assurance that the trusted certificate is very difficult to forge as it is generated using state-level encryption algorithms on the platform, linked to individual ID cards and secured with many layers of passwords.

(November 26, 2020) Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf and other state officials assailed a Pittsburgh judge for issuing what they described as an unprecedented order halting additional steps in the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's election victory. Mr Wolf and Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, both Democrats, asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to lift the order by Judge McCullough, a Republican, and dismiss the underlying suit, which claimed a state law passed to expand use of mail-in voting was illegal. The case is separate from the federal lawsuit by President Donald Trump's campaign that seeks to undo Pennsylvania's certification unless tens of thousands of allegedly illegal mail-in ballots are invalidated. The state case was brought by Republicans led by US Representative Mike Kelly. (Pennsylvania slams judge's 'overreach' in certification ruling — Strait Times) <br>

(November 26, 2020) But one mutation near the beginning of the pandemic did make a difference, multiple new findings suggest, helping the virus spread more easily from person to person and making the pandemic harder to stop. The mutation, known as 614G, was first spotted in eastern China in January and then spread quickly throughout Europe and New York City. Within months, the variant took over much of the world, displacing other variants. Side by side, did clusters of 614G infections grow faster than infections involving the ancestral variant? The 614G variant clearly won the race, the analysis found. The precise rate remains uncertain, but the most likely value gives 614G roughly a 20 per cent advantage in its exponential rate of growth.

(November 25, 2020) The Baidu Search Box and Baidu Maps collected information that could continue to track users even after they switched to new smartphones, the California-based Palo Alto Networks said in a report. The apps were downloaded a combined six million times in the United States and 1.4 billion times worldwide. Baidu’s “push” software development kit would pick up details such as the phone’s MAC address, carrier information and IMSI number, and send the information to an IP address in China, the report said. The IMSI is a unique identifier for a mobile carrier subscriber and is typically stored on a phone’s SIM card. “If a user switches their SIM card to a new phone and installs an application that previously collected and transmitted the IMSI number, the app developer is able to uniquely identify that user,” the researchers wrote, noting that the information could be exploited by cybercriminals.

(November 23, 2020) But since they’re also constrained on total votes, and they’ve already announced the in-person votes, they have to go back and actually re-classify some of the existing in-person votes as being mail votes (Fact 1). Because they’ve added both too many in-person votes total and too many in-person votes for Biden specifically, they decide to delete from the “in-person” a very large pile of Biden votes (since a fair number of these were fraudulent already, and now these can be better disguised with the mail ballots), and a smaller batch of other candidates (so it doesn’t look like only one candidate is changing) (Fact 5).

(November 24, 2020) Last week, the Canadian House of Commons voted 179-146 for this country to adopt a plan similar to Australia's to counter meddling by the People's Republic of China. Experts in Canada and Australia suggest that such a change would set Canada on a much more aggressive path in countering China's inroads into this country's institutions. ... Australian media reports on Dastyari suggested he was a good investment for China. He not only supported Beijing's claims to the South China Sea — in opposition to the official position of his Labor Party — he also worked to prevent a meeting between his party leader and a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist. Dominique Dalla-Pozza teaches at the Centre for Military and Security Law at the Australian National University in Canberra (which itself allegedly has been a target of a massive Chinese intelligence operation). ... Walsh said one of the most significant aspects of the law is that it allows Australia to fight back outside the courts.

(Aug 9, 2020) China’s social credit system, by its wide definition, is a set of databases and initiatives that monitor and assess the trustworthiness of individuals, companies and government entities. ... with the system expected to be rolled out by the end of 2020. The social credit system compiles a score for both individuals and companies after collecting, aggregating and analysing data from different sources. The aim of the system is to improve transparency for the public, although it also serves as a tool for the government to impose control on almost all aspects of its citizens’ lives. The NDRC said in July 2019 that 2.56 million people had been restricted from taking flights, 90,000 people had been prevented from using high-speed rail services and 300,000 people had been deemed untrustworthy by Chinese courts. Critics of China’s social credit system often say Beijing’s commitment to regulating behaviour and mass surveillance is Orwellian in nature, where a government tries to control every part of people's lives, similar to what was described in the novel 1984 by English author George Orwell.

"The simple recognition of this as part of Israel... was a decision President Trump made that is historically important and simply a recognition of the reality," he said. (BBC) <br>

(November 19, 2020) Speaking by video link from Beijing to a meeting of Asia-Pacific CEOs, Xi promised to open China’s market wider but announced no initiatives to respond to complaints the ruling Communist Party improperly subsidizes and shields technology and other industries from foreign competitors. “We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple or forming a ‘small circle' to keep others out," Xi said. Xi promised to cut tariffs but gave no details. (Xi: China will avoid decoupling amid tension with US, Europe — ABC) <br>

(November 18, 2020) The Iranian regime seeks a repeat of the failed experiment that lifted sanctions and shipped them huge amounts of cash in exchange for modest nuclear limitations.  The regime desperately needs an economic lifeline.  For that reason, they make two arguments: sanctions are useless and ineffective; or, in the alternative, when sanctions are effective they hurt only the Iranian people and not the regime; either way they should be removed.  The regime’s greatest fear is that sanctions will remain. (The Importance of Sanctions on Iran — Department of State) <br>

(Nov 12, 2019) The world needs "new ways of cooperation, new alliances," French President Emmanuel Macron said at the Paris Peace Forum on Tuesday. "We are experiencing an unprecedented crisis in our international system," Macron said. On Tuesday, Macron said there should be no "squeamishness or hypocrisy" when it comes to questioning the workings of international bodies such as the UN, which he said had become "blocked." China's Vice President Wang Qushan said that "tendency of replacing rational thinking and action with the outpouring of emotions" was not helpful.

(October 23, 2019) It has also presented a serious challenge to China's leaders in Beijing, who have painted the demonstrators as dangerous separatists and accused foreign powers of backing them. Critics of the planned law had feared extradition to mainland China could subject people to arbitrary detention and unfair trials. "There are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality," she said. The Financial Times newspaper reports that China's government is drawing up plans to remove Ms Lam, a figure loathed by protesters whom Beijing has thus far stood by.

(November 17, 2020) O'Toole said the western world has tolerated China's human rights abuses, intellectual property theft and manipulative trade practices for decades in order to gain access to the country's burgeoning economy. He said it's time for Canada and its closest allies to adopt a more aggressive posture. "The democratic world must acknowledge that the approach to China over the last two decades has not worked. In fact, the situation has gotten worse," O'Toole told reporters on Parliament Hill. He said the move to normalize relations and admit China to the World Trade Organization has had "catastrophic impacts for Canadian workers."

(November 16, 2020) At the outset, the Department identified academia as one of our most vulnerable sectors, because its traditions of openness, and the importance of international exchanges to the free flow of ideas, leave it vulnerable to PRC exploitation.  The Department has pursued a two-pronged strategy of raising awareness on campuses of the threats posed by China (and the importance of implementing a security program to detect them) and prosecuting researchers who have deliberately deceived authorities about their ties to China, which deprives institutions of the ability to screen for conflicts of interest and commitment, or otherwise exploited their access.

(October 19, 2020) Under the embargo, which came into effect in 2007, the export of "certain conventional arms to Iran" and the "procurement of any arms or related materiel from Iran" was cemented as a violation of the UN Security Council resolution and remained subject to sanctions. Yet, the UN adamantly rejected an appeal from the U.S. in August to extend the blockade. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a stark word of warning to anyone endeavoring to do arms deals with Iran. The country's defense minister, Amir Hatami, vowed during a Sunday evening television interview that they won't sell to countries that would "misuse" deadly arms, and would deploy weapons "strictly for defense purposes." "This is a big propaganda victory for Iran. They will take advantage of the opportunity to highlight Washington's isolation, even as their diplomatic victories pile up," Bruen added. (Fox News) <br>

Compensation, of course, is one aspect of it," Bains said back in January, adding that the government also wants "to demonstrate to businesses very clearly that there are going to be significant penalties for non-compliance with the law. That's really my primary goal." ... Earlier this month, a joint investigation by the federal, Alberta and B.C. privacy commissioners concluded that the real estate company behind some of Canada's most popular shopping centres embedded cameras inside its digital information kiosks at 12 shopping malls in major Canadian cities to collect millions of images — and used facial recognition technology without customers' knowledge or consent. ...

Government programs such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) were a lifeline for many of them, but with that program finished and now transferred into the less generous Canada Recovery Benefit — which is itself set to expire next year — the number of Canadians on a financial knife's edge is set to grow.

We also increased our simulated phishing campaigns and security awareness training offerings to empower our front-line defenses: our employees. We started locking down remote collaboration tools at the state level, and ran into some issues supporting public meetings, which need to be open and easy to access. So we pivoted to defaulting to the most secure collaboration tool settings and gave agencies the ability to modify their settings based on meeting the business's need. ... We are also enhancing our offensive security capabilities by increasing threat intelligence collection and analysis, and by hiring positions dedicated to pen testing and threat hunting.

(November 13, 2020) Sources tell CBC News the government's climate plan was approved by cabinet last month — but critics remain concerned about Canada's path to net-zero, which would require significantly reducing the country's carbon emissions and offsetting the remaining emissions with other measures, such as planting trees or carbon sequestration. Next month, the government is expected to roll out new standards for cleaner-burning fuels — which could account for about 15 per cent of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target — and to begin sector-by-sector consultations to set reduction targets, offer incentives to increase the use of clean energy and develop the market for electric vehicles.

(November 13, 2020) The attacks we have seen, not only in recent weeks, have shown the extent of the threat we face from all forms of terrorism. Only together we can put a stop to the terrorists and their backers. Given the transnational nature of terrorist networks, we can clearly see the extent to which measures at European level are important and necessary. We reaffirm our determination to do everything in our power to counter this barbaric terror holistically, with all the instruments at our disposal, while fully maintaining all guarantees under the rule of law as well as fundamental freedoms. Europe’s foundation will not be shaken by the scourge of violent extremism and terrorism. The terrorists cannot win their fight. We will take action against the threat of polarisation. In early December at the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs, we will present comprehensive Council conclusions on internal security and on a European police partnership. These conclusions will also address the key issue of preventing violent extremism and combating terrorism. (Council of the European Union) <br>

(November 13, 2020) Doshi, Assistant Professor for the UCL School of Management said, “Many models that predict false information use the content of articles or behaviors on social media channels to make their predictions. By the time that data is available, it may be too late. These producers are nimble and we need a way to identify them early. By using domain registration data, we can provide an early warning system using data that is arguably difficult for the actors to manipulate. Actors who produce false information tend to prefer remaining hidden and we use that in our model.” By applying a machine-learning model to domain registration data, the tool was able to correctly identify 92% of the false information domains and 96.2% of the non-false information domains set up in relation to the 2016 US election before they started operations. ... “Social media companies and regulators need to be more engaged in dealing with this very real issue and corporates need to have a plan in place to quickly identify when they become the target of this type of campaign.” (Security Magazine) <br>

Making false statements to the federal government is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. (Department of Justice) <br>

(November 6, 2020) The pandemic has been a wake-up call and companies, after assessing costs and benefits, may begin making shifts to their supply chains in order to reduce future 
risk. This may include moving in and out of certain regions, developing enhanced but practical approaches to risk mitigation, and diversifying supply sources. Given the global supply chain difficulties ICT companies are currently encountering because the virus adversely affects their ability to compress their cycle time, there are active policy discussions as to whether firms should be provided with various incentives to bring manufacturing home, closer to home, or to never leave in the first place.

(October 23, 2020) But comparing the total number to that expected number leads to a difference that ultimately leads to the 300,000 excess deaths that you just mentioned. About two-thirds of those we can link directly to COVID-19. What about the other third – that’s as you know an important question to address as well. ... Some of them also may be unrecognized impacts of COVID-19. So when we look at factors like cardiovascular death that aren’t directly linked to COVID-19, there’s not a really great explanation for why we would see that increase in cardiovascular death and we know that it’s possible that COVID-19 could be playing a role in those deaths as well. And overall I think it emphasizes the importance of the prevention measures that we’ve been talking about. (CDC) <br>

(November 12, 2020) The move is designed to deter US investment firms, pension funds and others from buying and selling shares of 31 Chinese companies that were designated by the Defence Department as backed by the Chinese military earlier this year. The executive order takes a page from a Bill, filed by Republican senator Marco Rubio last month, to block access to US capital markets for Chinese companies that have been blacklisted by Washington. In August, US Securities and Exchange Commission and Treasury officials urged Trump to delist Chinese companies that trade on US exchanges and fail to meet its auditing requirements by January 2022.

(November 12, 2020) The government said the latest update, which has been under discussion for at least five years, "harmonises" tax law with its criminal code, which banned private bribery in 2015. ... views of such practices have shifted, as international organisations like the OECD push for tougher rules against money laundering and bribery. The OECD has said favourable tax rules help to normalise such practices. Switzerland changed its tax rules for bribes to public officials in 2001. It made it a criminal offense for a company to bribe a private individual in 2015. (BBC News) <br>

(November 12, 2020) An Egyptian official cited by the Associated Press said the UH-60 Black Hawk was on a reconnaissance mission when it came down near the island of Tiran, adding that the crash appeared to have been caused by a technical failure. The crash involved the US-led Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) that was deployed to the desert peninsula in the early 1980s to monitor Egypt's 1979 peace deal with Israel. Its responsibilities include monitoring troops levels along Egypt's border with Israel and ensuring freedom of navigation through the Strait of Tiran. (DW News) <br>

(November 12, 2020) In separate calls with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Japan’s Yoshihide Suga and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Biden discussed the importance of bilateral relations in tackling key global challenges like the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. Biden and Moon reaffirmed their "firm commitment to a robust ROK-US alliance and peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula." During his conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Suga, Biden highlighted the need to work together in order to achieve "a free and open Indo-Pacific," possibly an indication that the Biden administration will move to control China's growing military and economic overtures in the region.

(November 11, 2020) IoT devices are expanding, boosting productivity and innovation across a variety of industries and organizations. Industrial IoT have transformed critical infrastructures such as healthcare, automotive, maritime and shipping. On the other hand, consumer IoT are being used extensively in homes to make our lives smarter and easier. However, despite the benefits, IoT present many risks mostly coupled the lack of visibility and secure architectures, resulting in an increased threat surface. A single compromised node can be leveraged to break into corporate networks with severe consequences. Sensors’ data is making the IoT a lucrative target. Insecure designs and architectures will result in non-encrypted personal data, hardcoded passwords, software and firmware updates from unverified sources. Issues related to wireless communication security will also increase. (Security Boulevard) <br>

(November 10, 2020) Cybercriminals will always follow users and launch attacks that exploit their behaviors and habits. We saw this very clearly in 2020 when employees suddenly became remote workers to comply with stay-at-home orders, and their use of technology and devices shifted. ... Amidst these challenges, cybercriminals are still targeting hospitals and healthcare providers--particularly with ransomware attacks that can disrupt their ability to provide care to patients. For example, earlier in 2020, a patient was unable to receive life-saving treatment after hackers disabled Düsseldorf University Hospital’s computer systems with ransomware, ultimately costing the patient her life. Knowing that cyberattacks can have fatal consequences and that many healthcare organizations may not have adequate cybersecurity controls in place, attackers are in a prime position to exfiltrate PHI or get healthcare organizations to pay a ransom. As such, healthcare institutions are going to be tasked with the physical and electronic well-being of patients; attackers will continue to target them as they face financial pressures. It’s true that financial services firms are not breached as frequently as those in other industries like healthcare. However, when financial firms are breached, these incidents tend to be much larger and more detrimental than those experienced by companies in other industries. ... Remote work and other technological advantages spurred by stay-at-home orders will long outlast the pandemic, granting organizations more flexibility, cost savings, and an overall edge in their business plans to conquer any other obstacles the future might bring them. History shows that attackers refine their methods to take advantage of global events and the adoption of new technologies. In fact, online crimes reported to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) have nearly quadrupled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Combining these trends with the rapid development and adoption of technologies like 5G (which enables malicious actors to execute attacks and move data much more quickly) suggests that we will see an increase in the number of people around the world who are impacted by data breaches.

(October 1, 2020) The idea behind the de-facto ban was to stop the importation of large quantities of cheap used clothing, mostly from the US and the UK, which the African nations said were stifling the growth of their nascent garment industries. ...

The US responded by putting tariffs of 30% on Rwandan clothing, where there had previously been none. ... "The government should have waited until the country had build a mature textile industry before banning chagua," says clothes seller Felicien Maniraguha.

(August 11, 2020) Despite the political conflicts between China and Canada which have caused major trade disputes, Canada’s canola is still on top. Canola producers say they are getting top dollar this harvest, partly thanks to middle-man trade deals. “While it’s true that some of the oil produced in Dubai from our canola is going to China, it’s also true that we’ve exported similar amounts to Dubai in the past,” Innes explained.

But the first step was taken when Gorbachev came to power in 1985. Six years later, in 1991, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. (DW News) <br>

(November 9, 2020) China has offered Jamaica loans and expertise to build miles of new highways. Throughout the Caribbean, it has donated security equipment to military and police forces and built a network of Chinese cultural centres. The Caribbean markets are generally small, and most of the nations there lack the sizable reserves of minerals and other raw materials that often draw Chinese attention. China's efforts in the region are part of its global strategy to forge deep economic ties and strong diplomatic relationships around the world, in part through the building of major infrastructure projects under its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. "China's objective is to gradually eliminate the recognition of Taiwan," Bernal said. The total climbs by US$62 billion with the addition of assistance to Venezuela, much of it given in return for long-term oil supplies. In November 2019, the Jamaican government announced that it would stop negotiating new loans from China as part of its effort to reduce debt quickly ... But Jamaican officials say outstanding Chinese loans are not putting an extraordinary burden on the country. The pandemic allowed China to strengthen these relationships further by donating or selling personal protective equipment, in what has come to be called "mask diplomacy." (Strait Times) <br>

(November 8, 2020) According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday. He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. He will end the travel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries. He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children. ... The Biden team said it would ensure all Americans had access to regular and free testing and provide "clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance" to communities. Mr Biden also wants rules mandating the wearing of masks across the country, which he says would save thousands of lives. Mr Biden also announced plans to reboot the virus-hit US economy, which has seen millions more people become unemployed, by boosting manufacturing, investing in infrastructure, making childcare more affordable and reducing the wealth gap between different ethnic groups. He wants measures including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities, fair treatment and pay for workers and enabling the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, which sets monetary policy - to do more to reduce racial wealth disparities. "Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system," his plan says. ...

The international community finds this unacceptable,” he added. Biden might restart negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a major initiative of the Barack Obama administration that tied free trade to labor and environmental standards — with the goal of isolating China and pressuring the country into opening its markets, said Hung Ho-fung, a political economy professor at John Hopkins University.

(Sep. 29, 2020) The country is the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for 28% of global emissions, and its move may inspire other countries to follow suit.

He says the new targets “won’t likely let us to stop at 1.5° Celsius [of global warming],” the preferred target set in the 2015 Paris agreement. “But below 2° might still be consistent with [Xi’s] announcement.” China has not yet revealed details of how it will do this. But a research group at Tsinghua University presented a $15 trillion, 30-year road map on 27 September that calls for ending the use of coal for electricity generation around 2050, dramatically increasing nuclear and renewable power generation, and relying on electricity for 80% of China’s energy consumption by 2060. ... Last year, the carbon-heavy fuel accounted for about 58% of China’s total energy consumption and 66% of its electricity generation. A recent study by Myllyvirta and colleagues found that China’s coal-fired generating capacity grew by about 40 gigawatts (GW) in 2019, to about 1050 GW. Another 100 GW is under construction and coal interests are lobbying for even more plants. “This is all despite significant overcapacity in the sector,” with plants running at less than 50% of capacity and many coal-power companies losing money, the study said. ... China’s interest in climate change has waned in recent years, due to the slowing down of economic growth and the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement,” (Science) <br>

Biden used his victory speech in Wilmington, Delaware, to announce that he plans to assemble a panel of scientists next week to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Biden vowed to unify, not divide the nation. He also reached out to those who voted for his opponent, Republican Donald Trump: "They are not our enemies. They are Americans." ... Relations between the US and Iran deteriorated under Donald Trump, who pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump, during his term, recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War, and brokered normalization deals between Israel and Gulf states. The Palestinians have been hoping for a chance to hit the reset button on relations with Washington after Abbas ended all political dealings with President Donald Trump's administration, ...

One major issue continues to hover over the continent: whether Canada will wind up spending billions to install new radar over the Arctic. ... Trump withdrew from the World Health Organization, partially paralyzed the World Trade Organization, part of China-U.S. disputes that touched agriculture, educational exchanges, journalism, new technologies and sanctioned goods. Biden, however, says he wants to approach things differently — for starters, by working more closely with allies. ... Biden has said he would reverse Trump's H1-B visa freeze, review the decision to end humanitarian protection for migrants, repeal Trump's travel ban and increase the number of refugees coming into the U.S. to 125,000. Biden's platform says he also wants to convene a meeting with Canada, Mexico, and other countries in the region to develop an international plan to deal with irregular migration and its root causes.

(November 7, 2020) It's no surprise, then, that his Democratic rival Joe Biden has pledged to restore US manufacturing hegemony and that more products will be "made in all of America." Although the coronavirus pandemic would be his administration's first priority, Biden said he wanted to expand the use of Buy American rules to help boost domestic manufacturing and create millions of new production jobs, including a million in the auto sector. The former vice president's economic plans include a 10% tax on firms who offshore US manufacturing and would eliminate loopholes that help US multinationals to shield their foreign profits from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). "If the Senate remains under Republican control, it is difficult to see Biden getting much done legislatively, including implementing his 'Made in America' plan," Zandi said. "A very high proportion of US-owned manufacturing abroad is producing for sale and use in the country or region where the plant is located," noted economist Ed Lotterman. After all, US multinationals often move production overseas to benefit from new and untapped markets, like Brazil and China. ... Biden plans to enlarge the federal deficit — already at $3.3 trillion (€2.8 trillion), or 16% of GDP — with his huge spending plan worth $5.4 trillion over the next decade. According to his campaign website, joebiden.com, a huge investment to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure will help him meet his target for full employment, while education will account for most of the new public spending. Large tax hikes, mostly on the wealthy, will reverse some of Trump's $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and will offset almost two-thirds of his spending commitments, the rest would benefit from the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, analysts have said. ... Corporate America will pressure Biden to undo many of Trump's aggressive trade policies that, as well as tackling China's economic threat, have weakened ties with the United States' strongest allies, including Mexico and the European Union. But trade experts have said Biden's hands may be tied by his commitment to voters through the Made In America pledge, and that tariffs may remain for some time, despite the huge cost to US importers. "Biden will continue to put pressure on the Chinese to abide by international trade law, but he will not do this through a unilateral trade war," Zandi predicted. "He will reengage with the World Trade Organization and other multilateral trade organizations to put pressure on the Chinese to change their behavior." (DW News) <br>

Some Africans have joked on social media that the US is becoming more or less like a post-colonial African state. "Trump's exit leaves us, the African youth, perplexed. We have been observing from a distance, but when this country, which gives a lot of lessons in democracy to African countries, starts to experience this democratic debacle, we wonder whether the world is in peril," Mutombo said.

(November 7, 2020) Simons himself may not want Democrat Joe Biden in the White House based on some of his campaign promises, but he's keenly aware that the energy sector has more pressing problems than politics. Even if possible impacts from the U.S. election are relatively small, some in the Canadian oilpatch are nervous because the sector is already under severe financial pressure. Biden has vowed to make policy changes that critics argue would be a setback for the oil and gas sector, such as preventing new drilling on federal land in the U.S. and cancelling the presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would help deliver Alberta crude to the U.S.'s Gulf Coast refineries.

On election night, Trump suggested that ballot-counting issues could be dealt with at the U.S. Supreme Court. ... Barr has said in both testimony and interviews this year that he believes mail balloting greatly raises the prospect for fraud. ... Georgia: A Trump campaign lawsuit filed in Chatham County asking a judge to ensure the state laws are being followed on absentee ballots was dismissed Thursday morning. Michigan: The Associated Press projected Michigan's 16 electoral college votes for Biden, with a Trump campaign lawsuit claiming Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, was allowing absentee ballots to be counted without teams of bipartisan observers as well as challengers. Nevada: Trump's campaign said Thursday in Las Vegas that it would file a lawsuit later in the day alleging thousands of people cast ballots who no longer live in the state. The Las Vegas area is the biggest Democratic stronghold in an otherwise predominantly Republican state. Pennsylvania: As with Michigan, Trump surrogates have argued over access in numerous locations while also seeking to intervene in a Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court that deals with whether ballots received up to three days after the election can be counted, deputy campaign manager Justin Clark said.

(November 6, 2020) South Korea is still campaigning for its candidate, Yoo Myung-hee, to be named the next director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on November 9. Member nations are due to select the successor to Roberto Azevedo — who stepped down from the WTO's top job at the end of August, a year before his term ended — and the choice has been narrowed down from eight to just two names. The decision to name the next WTO head needs to be approved by consensus, meaning any of the 164 members could block the appointment. The lack of a consensus threatens to render the WTO leaderless at a time when the global economy is facing headwinds from the coronavirus pandemic, increased protectionist tendencies worldwide and the US-China trade conflict, among other things.

(October 20, 2020) When it comes to jobs, debt and housing, Canada’s economic trajectory has split into two, data shows. It’s what economists refer to as a “K-shaped” recovery.

On the lower-arm of the K are hourly workers, who are more likely to hold jobs that require face-to-face interaction and be employed in the industries that have been hardest-hit by the lockdown, such as hospitality, retail and entertainment. Young people, whose jobs are often first to be axed in a downturn, are also overrepresented in the bottom half of the K. (Global News) <br>

(Nov. 1, 2020) No candidate for president with a legacy of 36 years in the Senate and eight in the West Wing should need an economic projection to tell voters what his policies will do. Like it or not, Joe Biden has a record. To obscure that record, Mr. Biden and his team have turned to rewritten history and, even worse, abstract projections to try to convince voters that the same policies that gave us the weakest recovery since the Great Depression will work miracles now, if we simply double down on taxing, spending and regulating.

How could anyone believe that after a progressive program of tax, spend and regulatory control failed during the Obama-Biden administration, Biden-Harris could succeed with a socialist program of taxes, spending and controls at levels Mr. Obama never dared? ... If Biden-Harris-Sanders-Warren-Pelosi-AOC control the White House and Congress, and kill the fossil-fuel industry with the Green New Deal, override state right-to-work laws, pack the Supreme Court, pack the Senate by admitting the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states, expand the spending blowout and raise marginal tax rates to over 50%, will this still be the same country you were born in or came to seeking refuge and opportunity?

(October 25, 2020) British Columbia voters appear to have rewarded John Horgan’s pandemic gamble by giving his NDP a majority mandate.
