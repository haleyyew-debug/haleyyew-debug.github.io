(April 11, 2021) Once operational, the KF-21 — which looks very much like the American F-35 — is expected to be armed with a range of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and possibly even air-launched cruise missiles. “When the final tests are completed in the future, South Korea will become the eighth country in the world that has developed an advanced supersonic fighter,” a government statement said. The KF-21 is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia in which Seoul holds 80% of shares while Jakarta seeks 20%. While the KF-21 also has significant export potential because its price tag is expected to be significantly lower than the F-35s the US sells to foreign militaries. Thailand, the Philippines and possibly even Iraq could be leading clients for the fighter. (South Korea soars into elite group with K-21 fighter — Asia Times) <br>

(April 11, 2021) Justin Welby, leader of the global Anglican Communion, said the fact the prince had lived to within two months of his 100th birthday did not soften the blow for those who had loved him. “Loss is loss,” he said. “We may pray and offer love for all who find that a great life leaves a very great gap.” (UK churches celebrate the 'great life' of Prince Philip — Reuters) <br>

(April 11, 2021) “The key to this triumphant future will be to build on the gains our amazing movement has made over the past four years,” Trump told hundreds of leading Republican donors, according to the prepared remarks. “Under our leadership, we welcomed millions upon millions of new voters into the Republican coalition. We transformed the Republican Party into a party that truly fights for all Americans.” (The key to Republican success is more Trumpism — AP) <br>

(April 10, 2021) Regulators in China said the internet giant had abused its dominant market position for several years. Analysts say the fine shows China intends to move against internet platforms that it thinks are too big. "It's indeed the highest profile anti-monopoly case in China. The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation." (Chinese regulator slaps huge fine on tech giant — BBC) <br>

(April 9, 2021) Yet there appears to be far less worry in Beijing about the fate of the landmark deal than in some European countries and conglomerates that may be bigger beneficiaries. Known clauses of the deal set out goals for Beijing to pull down regulatory hurdles for European firms to run wholly-owned subsidiaries and plants in sectors ranging from automobile, telecommunications, manufacturing to finance. “But politics is still a thorn between China and the EU, when, despite these concessions on offer, the bloc chose to side with the United States to close ranks against China over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since the deal is never welcomed at home and European companies may benefit more, Beijing won’t mind too much if it is put on ice when China-EU relations have already become so frayed,” said the Fudan University scholar. (Beijing keeps cool as landmark EU pact goes on ice — Asia Times) <br>

(April 9, 2021) Taiwan is home to 92% of the world's leading-edge chip manufacturing operations and a vital center for producing other tech components, including laptops and PC motherboards. The U.S. consumed more than $63 billion worth of Taiwanese tech exports throughout the first eight months of last year, or 32 percent of the island's output. China accounted for 30% and Europe about 22%, per Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute. If Taiwan's chip production were permanently disrupted, the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates it would take three years and $350 billion in investment to build enough capacity to replace it. That's why many in the industry are calling for the U.S. to be clearer about its support for Taiwan and, at the same time, to encourage investment in domestic chip production. (Why threats to Taiwan are a nightmare for tech — Axios) <br>

(April 9, 2021) Gunmen shot dead a Greek crime reporter outside his Athens home on Friday, officials said, sending shockwaves across the country. Maria Antoniadou, the head of the journalists union ESIEA, said: “Whoever thinks that, in this way, they can silence journalists – there are another 6,099 who will investigate and demand to know what has happened." (Greek reporter shot dead in ‘execution-style’ murder — DW News) <br>

(April 9, 2021) Peatlands are major stores of carbon. Indonesia has cleared and drained millions of hectares of peatlands for agriculture, creating highly flammable landscapes that, when burned, create toxic smog and huge amounts of carbon emissions. "There have been systematic violations of regulations, allowing new plantation concessions to continue to push into Indonesia's forest estate," said Mr Kiki Taufik, Greenpeace's global head of Indonesia Forest Campaign, adding that Greenpeace found clear violations in Papua Province. "But these same problems occur nationwide." (Indonesia aims to reduce fires even further by all means: Environment and Forestry Minister — Strait Times) <br>

(April 8, 2021) “Even though I’m sort of a pro-crypto, pro-Bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether at this point Bitcoin should also be thought in part of as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S., where it threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the U.S. dollar, and China wants to do things to weaken it,” At some US$1 trillion in value, Bitcoin is also the third-largest currency in the world behind the U.S. dollar and the euro, a recent research report published by Deutsche Bank shows. Thiel said Washington should be highly guarded against geopolitical risks associated with future growth of the Bitcoin, particularly if it would affect the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.

(April 8, 2021) Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the market operator, will further expand its circuit-breaker mechanism starting on April 19 to temper wild swings in the price of futures contracts in Asia’s third-largest capital market. The move will add to similar controls put in place since August 2016, first on extreme gyrations in stocks and a year later on derivative products. They followed a series of events that provoked regulatory probes into market misconduct such as price manipulation and pump-and-dump scandals. (HKEX to extend price-swing controls to futures products from Monday — SCMP) <br>

(April 8, 2021) The U.S. State Department on Thursday played down expectations for talks on how Washington and Tehran might resume compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and said the U.S. envoy was likely to return home as the talks break for the weekend. While echoing descriptions of the talks as “constructive,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters “we would also, however, hasten to not allow expectations to outpace where we are.” (U.S. plays down expectations for Vienna Iran nuclear talks — Reuters) <br>

(April 8, 2021) US intelligence officials are painting a dark picture of the world’s future, writing in a new report that the coronavirus pandemic has deepened economic inequality, strained government resources and fanned nationalist sentiments. Those assessments are included in a Global Trends report by the government’s National Intelligence Council. The reports, produced every four years, are designed to help policymakers and citizens anticipate the economic, environmental, technological and demographic forces likely to shape the world through the next 20 years.

(March 2021) Published every four years since 1997, Global Trends assesses the key trends and uncertainties that will shape the strategic environment for the United States during the next two decades. Global Trends reflects the National Intelligence Council’s perspective on these future trends; it does not represent the official, coordinated view of the US Intelligence Community nor US policy. We are proud to publish this report publicly for audiences around the world to read and consider. We hope that it serves as a useful resource and provokes a conversation about our collective future.

(April 7, 2021) A database shared with The Post has a spreadsheet listing the names, birth dates and passport numbers of 697 US citizens, some of them children, who were flagged while passing through Pudong International Airport in 2018 and 2020. Security experts believe the documents — contained on Shanghai Public Security Bureau servers — provide a glimpse into Beijing's massive data collection efforts targeting foreigners. The database was leaked to Internet 2.0, an Australia-based cyber-security firm, which said the records give "an unprecedented view on how China is building its surveillance state with technology and how it leverages data as a means of control." In addition to the details of international visitors, the database also contains a blacklist of people monitored or questioned in Shanghai, many of them deemed "terrorists" — including thousands of Uighur Muslims, a minority group targeted by the Chinese Communist Party, Internet 2.0 found. This shows "how China blurs the boundaries between law and order, counter-terrorism and political crimes," the company said in a statement.

(April 7, 2021) Taiwan will fight to the end if China attacks, its foreign minister said on Wednesday (April 7), adding that the United States saw a danger that this could happen amid mounting Chinese military pressure, including aircraft carrier drills, near the island. "From my limited understanding of American decision makers watching developments in this region, they clearly see the danger of the possibility of China launching an attack against Taiwan," Mr Joseph Wu told reporters at his ministry.

(April 7, 2021) The other activists who pleaded guilty were Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum. “I plead guilty, but I’ve done no wrong in affirming the rights of people to peaceful procession and I believe history will absolve me,” Lee said. Other cases facing the tycoon, who has been in jail for months after being denied bail in another case, include charges of colluding with foreign forces under the new security law. His repeated arrests have drawn criticism from Western governments and international rights groups. (Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai among three pleading guilty to illegal assembly — Reuters) <br>

(April 7, 2021) The former heads of Xinjiang's justice and education departments have been sentenced to death with a reprieve. China continues to reject allegations of rights abuses against the Muslim Uyghur minority. Reprieve sentences, like those given to the two convicted men, are often commuted to life imprisonment. China said it has been pursuing a campaign against what it calls "two-faced officials" who are supposedly trying to undermine Chinese rule in the region. Sawut — the former director of the Xinjiang education department — was found guilty of including ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism and religious extremism content in Uyghur language textbooks.

"I was given just two meals a day, which were brought to the room by a designated person." "You have to accept the statement they prepare for you." Li added that if "you refuse, you will be seen as having a bad attitude and they will keep you in detention and keep on beating you." The suppression affected both Protestants and Catholics, with priests disappearing for "five, six, even 10 years at a stretch," he said.

(April 6, 2021) "Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations," she said. Yellen's speech comes days after President Joe Biden announced plans to raise the corporate tax to finance a massive $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs program. The critics argue that the higher rates would make the US less attractive to companies, that would then relocate to countries with lower corporate tax rates. A global minimum would at least partially offset any disadvantage that might arise from the proposed increase in the US rates.

(June 1848) “Make your story a short one,” said he, putting his hand on the small silver bell that stood on the table beside him, “or I shall be obliged to call for assistance. I am in no state to bear your brutalities now, or your presence either.” And in truth the moisture started from his pores and stood on his pale forehead like dew. Such a reception was hardly calculated to diminish the difficulties of my unenviable task. It must be performed however, in some fashion; and so I plunged into it at once, and floundered through it as I could. “The truth is, Lawrence,” said I, “I have not acted quite correctly towards you of late—especially on this last occasion; and I’m come to—in short, to express my regret for what has been done, and to beg your pardon. If you don’t choose to grant it,” I added hastily, not liking the aspect of his face, “it’s no matter; only I’ve done my duty—that’s all.” “It’s easily done,” replied he, with a faint smile bordering on a sneer: “to abuse your friend and knock him on the head without any assignable cause, and then tell him the deed was not quite correct, but it’s no matter whether he pardons it or not.” “I forgot to tell you that it was in consequence of a mistake,”—muttered I. “I should have made a very handsome apology, but you provoked me so confoundedly with your—. Well, I suppose it’s my fault. The fact is, I didn’t know that you were Mrs. Graham’s brother, and I saw and heard some things respecting your conduct towards her which were calculated to awaken unpleasant suspicions, that, allow me to say, a little candour and confidence on your part might have removed; and, at last, I chanced to overhear a part of a conversation between you and her that made me think I had a right to hate you.” “And how came you to know that I was her brother?” asked he, in some anxiety. “She told me herself. She told me all. She knew I might be trusted. But you needn’t disturb yourself about that, Mr. Lawrence, for I’ve seen the last of her!” “The last! Is she gone, then?” “No; but she has bid adieu to me, and I have promised never to go near that house again while she inhabits it.” I could have groaned aloud at the bitter thoughts awakened by this turn in the discourse. But I only clenched my hands and stamped my foot upon the rug. My companion, however, was evidently relieved. “You have done right,” he said, in a tone of unqualified approbation, while his face brightened into almost a sunny expression. “And as for the mistake, I am sorry for both our sakes that it should have occurred. Perhaps you can forgive my want of candour, and remember, as some partial mitigation of the offence, how little encouragement to friendly confidence you have given me of late.” “Yes, yes—I remember it all: nobody can blame me more than I blame myself in my own heart; at any rate, nobody can regret more sincerely than I do the result of my brutality, as you rightly term it.” “Never mind that,” said he, faintly smiling; “let us forget all unpleasant words on both sides, as well as deeds, and consign to oblivion everything that we have cause to regret. Have you any objection to take my hand, or you’d rather not?” It trembled through weakness as he held it out, and dropped before I had time to catch it and give it a hearty squeeze, which he had not the strength to return. “How dry and burning your hand is, Lawrence,” said I. “You are really ill, and I have made you worse by all this talk.” (Anne Brontë, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, CHAPTER XLV) <br>

(April 4, 2021) “The continued presence of Chinese maritime militias in the area reveals their intent to further occupy (areas) in the West Philippine Sea,” Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said in a statement, using the local name for the South China Sea. “I am no fool. The weather has been good so far, so they have no reason to stay there,” he said. “They have done this (occupy disputed areas) before at Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc and at Panganiban Reef, brazenly violating Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights under international law,” Lorenzana said in his Sunday statement.

(April 4, 2021) The US has never before faced from the Soviet Union or its western competitors this sort of challenge that China is posing today by offering to the regional states an altogether new path of development and governance that gives primacy to their national identity as sovereign states, keen to diversify their economies and not merely continue as gas stations for Big Oil. China’s offer is seductive: it does not take sides in the intra-regional rifts and schisms and instead wants regional players to follow an inclusive and reconciliatory approach to build a security architecture of their own that accommodates the legitimate concerns of all sides. And yet, China calculates that the outcome will be that the region would eventually step out of the shadows of western dominance to independently pursue its policies and resist US pressure and interference. China is playing the long game. Wang’s regional tour of West Asia marks China’s belief and confidence that it is on the right side of history.

(September 30, 1999) Scouts are beginning to return and the news is not good. The first to return did not get far before running into groups of the undead. It seems the Death Knight had an ingenious thought. His troops were left to guard the dwellings of all citizens of Tatalia. When the new recruits, ready to fight for Tatalia emerged each week, the undead were to attack. Powerful magicks were placed so if a group of undead simply stayed in the area, their numbers would cause the fallen Tatalians to rise from the dead and join the ranks of the enemy. With this tactic the Death Knight's armies will swell each week, and soon be unstoppable. The next few scouts reported this tactic as being used in a widespread manner. The undead must be cleared from the land and the Tatalians freed from their bony grasp. (Heroes of Might and Magic III, Armageddon's Blade, March of the Undead) <br>

(April 3, 2021) The huge project, which holds an estimated 2.4 billion tonnes of iron ore graded at over 65.5 per cent, could diversify China’s supply chain but may not cut out Canberra completely, analysts say. Australia is the source of about 60 per cent of China’s iron ore imports. Besides Guinea, there are alternative iron ore resources across Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Liberia, Mauritania, Sierra Leone and South Africa, but Widnell said none could match the scale of Simandou.

These include confidentiality clauses that prevent borrowers from revealing the terms of the loans, informal collateral arrangements that benefit Chinese lenders over other creditors and promises to keep the debt out of collective restructurings - dubbed by the authors as "no Paris Club" clauses - the report said. The contracts also give substantial leeway for China to cancel loans or accelerate repayment, it added.

The diplomat said there should be "accountability for the past," positioning himself in contrast to his predecessor Mike Pompeo, who had called for China to be punished, per CNN.

"They are not just cracking down on the protesters," said David, whose name has been changed for his own safety. "They are now entering the neighborhood and shooting and beating and looting everything that's in their sight." The death toll from the military crackdown reached nearly 400 on Saturday.

(December 2009) With a large number of examples and a large space, however, some difficulties arise: 1. Checking all the previous examples over again for each modification is very expensive. 2. The search process may involve a great deal of backtracking. As we saw in Chapter 18, hypothesis space can be a doubly exponentially large place. ... As various hypotheses are found to be inconsistent with the examples, this disjunction shrinks, retaining only those hypotheses not ruled out. ... We already said that the hypothesis space is enormous, so how can we possibly write down this enormous disjunction? ... Every hypothesis more specific than some member of the G-set and more general than some member of the S-set is a consistent hypothesis. (That is, there are no “holes” between the boundaries.) ... Figure 19.5 shows the situation: there are no known examples outside S but inside G, so any hypothesis in the gap must be consistent. ... This may appear rather complicated at first, but from the definitions and with the help of Figure 19.4, it is not too hard to reconstruct the algorithm. ... No known examples lie in between the two sets of boundaries. ... The version space collapses—either S or G becomes empty, indicating that there are no consistent hypotheses for the training set. ... The problem of disjunction can be addressed by allowing only limited forms of disjunction or by including a generalization hierarchy of more general predicates.

(March 24, 2021) China is rapidly expanding its activities in Manila-claimed waters in the South China Sea, maritime moves that come amid lingering uncertainties in the US-Philippine strategic alliance. The US Embassy in Manila, however, was quick to declare, “We stand with the Philippines, our oldest treaty ally in Asia” and accused China of intimidating rival claimant states in the South China Sea through its armada of maritime militia forces. Emboldened by Manila’s acquiescence, Beijing has rapidly militarized disputed land features by deploying sophisticated military hardware to newly-reclaimed areas in the South China Sea. China’s increasing reliance on “gray zone” tactics to push its claims in the area culminated in the sinking of a Philippine fishing vessel by a suspected Chinese militia vessel in the Reed Bank area in mid-2019. Contrary to Duterte’s generally meek position, his top cabinet members and legislative allies have taken a dramatically tougher stance against China’s intrusions into Philippine-claimed waters. Despite those protests, there has been no sign of a Chinese militia force withdrawal from the contested area, which some in the Philippines view as the strategic cost of lingering uncertainties in the Philippine-US alliance.

(March 20, 2021) "We discussed opportunities to elevate the US-India major defense partnership, which is a priority of the Biden-Harris administration. And we'll do that through regional security cooperation and military to military interactions and defense trade," he added. The Quad held a summit last weekend, affirming their joint interest in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The members also agreed to cooperate on dealing with maritime and cybersecurity challenges from China. (US seeks to strengthen security ties with India — DW News) <br>

(March 19, 2021) “On economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners, and we will move forward on them in a way that totally protects and advances the interests of our workers and our businesses,” Blinken said. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi said that confrontation would be a “disaster” for both nations. Biden, who referred to Xi as a “thug” during his election campaign, said after the call that the United States needed to raise its game in the face of the Chinese challenge, or China would “eat our lunch.” “I have many policy disagreements with the Biden administration, but every single American should unite against Beijing’s tyrants,” Republican Senator Ben Sasse said in a statement.

(March 19, 2021) However, a US official said the subsequent talks behind closed doors had been "substantive, serious and direct" and ran over the planned two hours. In a blunt opening statement before the talks in private, Mr Blinken said the US would "discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies". "Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said. In later remarks via state media, Chinese officials said it had been the US, not China, that had violated protocol by exceeding the agreed time in opening remarks. They accused the US of making a "groundless attack on China's domestic and foreign policies". Mr Sullivan hit back, saying Washington did not seek a conflict with China, but added: "We will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends."

(March 19, 2021) Because access to Xinjiang is heavily restricted by the Chinese, Amnesty spoke to Uighurs who were able to flee Xinjiang before the repression of the Uighur people intensified in 2017. In November 2019, Mihriban and Ablikim received a permit from the Italian government to bring their children to join them, but the children were seized by Chinese police on the way and sent to a state-run orphanage, Amnesty said. Omer and Meryem Faruh, who fled to Turkey in late 2016, left their two youngest children, aged five and six, with grandparents because they did not yet have their own travel documents, Amnesty said. They found out later that the grandparents had been arrested and sent to a camp and have not heard from their children since.

(March 18, 2021) One of two Canadians detained by China more than two years ago on suspicion of espionage, Michael Spavor, was due to go on trial on Friday amid heightened diplomatic tensions. Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to Beijing, said the timing of the trials was clearly designed to coincide with the talks between the United States and China, which wants to pressure the Biden administration to arrange for Meng’s release.

(March 18, 2021) China has raised the ante significantly by giving its Coast Guard the right to challenge and shoot back in any confrontation with Japan around the contested island chain. This week’s US-China Alaska meeting may help Japan to decide on its next steps regarding the issue, but so far it appears Japan is playing a waiting game while continuing to lose leverage in enforcing its sovereign rights over the Senkakus.

(March 18, 2021) The objects that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is juggling are $4.2 trillion in new Treasury debt to finance this year’s US government deficit. Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting commanded the market’s undivided attention. And Powell did not disappoint: the FOMC’s statement declared that everything was terrible, the US economy was weak, inflation was low. As long as the US government can sell 5-year bonds at an after-inflation yield of about negative 2 percent, which means that investors are paying the Treasury to hold their money for them, the US government can run any kind of deficit it likes.

(March 17, 2021) The vice president said that Magufuli died at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, the Indian Ocean port that is Tanzania’s largest city. Magufuli was one of Africa’s most prominent deniers of COVID-19. He had said last year that Tanzania had eradicated the disease through three days of national prayer. Tanzania has not reported its COVID-19 tallies of confirmed cases and deaths to African health authorities since April 2020. (Tanzania's President John Magufuli has died at 61 — Fox News) <br>

Another police report was lodged by Perikatan Nasional Youth member Mohammad Azwan Azmi about the film poster, as he claimed it contained racially sensitive words. ... He added: "If something really happens to me, I want everyone to boldly follow the path of democracy and freedom.

(March 17, 2021) The European Union's 27 ambassadors agreed on Wednesday to impose new sanctions on individuals from China and other countries over human rights abuses, two EU diplomats have said. They will be the first sanctions against Beijing since an EU arms embargo in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The embargo is still in place. The agreement on sanctions comes after a planned visit by EU ambassadors to China's Xinjiang region, where the Uighurs largely live, was refused permission over a request to see jailed Uighur academic Ilham Tohti.

(March 17, 2021) Austin was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks with South Korean officials on how best to counter the security risks posed by China's growing influence and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In first comments carried by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, Austin emphasized the importance of the US-South Korean alliance in the face of the threats from China and North Korea.

(March 17, 2021) South Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent. Capt Baker said investigators were "very confident" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. South Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. "We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere," he said. (Asian women among eight killed at three spas — BBC) <br>

(March 16, 2021) There are no illusions in the Biden team. Ahead of the meeting Mr Blinken noted this was "not a strategic dialogue" and there was "no intent at this point for a series of follow-on engagements". If by "Cold War" one means a great titanic struggle involving all aspects of national power waged between two incompatible political systems, then clearly the US-China rivalry has echoes of the US-Soviet confrontation. So in superficial terms maybe the "Cold War" label appears appropriate, but how useful is it really? In the original Cold War, the Soviet Union and its allies were largely isolated from the world economy and subject to strict export controls. In stark contrast, China is a lynch-pin of the global economy, and its own economy is deeply integrated with that of the United States. But the Cold War model is deeply dangerous in a fundamental respect. In the final analysis, one side was actually defeated - the Soviet system was swept away on the tide of history. And many fear that seeing the US-China rivalry in these stark ideological terms could lead to miscalculation on both sides, and give Beijing in particular all the more reason to go to potentially catastrophic lengths to avoid a possible defeat. Beijing has in many ways stolen a march on Washington. But will its authoritarian drift hamper its economic progress? Can China cope with slowing economic growth and an ageing population? And will the Communist Party be able to retain the loyalty and support of Chinese society in the long-term? (Beyond the 'Cold War' cliche — BBC) <br>

(March 16, 2021) U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned China on Tuesday against using “coercion and aggression” as he sought to use his first trip abroad to shore up Asian alliances in the face of growing assertiveness by Beijing.

(March 16, 2021) Multiple school principals have confirmed to Apple Daily that they have received calls from the education authority last week, claiming they were conducting a “survey” on whether and how many spy cameras have been installed on campus, as well as the locations and amount of money involved. The officials, however, did not ask for the schools’ opinion on bringing CCTV in classrooms. Lawyer Chong Yiu-kwong said it would be difficult to prove the necessity of installing CCTV in classrooms. It is unreasonable to invade a teachers’ privacy with cameras when he or she has no prior record of inappropriate behavior in class.

(March 16, 2021) According to a report by French online media La Lettre A on March 15, Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye wrote a "scathing letter" to Senator Alain Richard on Feb. 18, asking him to cancel his plan to lead a parliamentary delegation to visit Taiwan this summer. Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the same day that Beijing's "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy is not acceptable to any civilized country and stressed that Taiwan welcomed friends from around the world. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), meanwhile, condemned China for its efforts to suppress Taiwan's international space, saying such efforts will only deepen the distaste the Taiwanese people feel for the Chinese government.

(March 16, 2021) According to the latest statistics, the US remains the world’s largest arms exporter, increasing its global share of arms exports from 32% to 37% between 2011–15 and 2016–20. Exports by China, the world’s fifth-largest arms exporter in 2016–20, decreased by 7.8% between 2011–15 and 2016–20. Chinese arms exports accounted for 5.2% of total arms exports in 2016–20. Asia and Oceania was the largest importing region for major arms, receiving 42% of global arms transfers in 2016–20. India, Australia, China, South Korea and Pakistan were the biggest importers in the region. In 2016–20 Russia supplied 30% of arms imports by countries in sub-Saharan Africa, China 20%, France 9.5% and the US 5.4%. (US leads arms exporters, China sales fall — Asia Times) <br>

(March 15, 2021) In Tokyo, Blinken and Lloyd will hold in-person diplomatic and security talks on Tuesday with their Japanese counterparts, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, as well as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. After South Korea, Pentagon chief Lloyd will head to India for talks with his counterpart Rajnath Singh. Blinken will return to the US, and is expected to meet national security advisor Jake Sullivan for talks in Anchorage, Alaska with Chinese government officials. Washington is also seeking to increase US military capability. Before leaving for Japan, Blinken said that the US' "competitive edge" is eroding as China modernizes its military. "Our goal is to make sure that we have the capabilities … to be able to offer a credible deterrence to China," he said. (Biden administration officials make first Asia trip — DW News) <br>

(March 15, 2021) The report revealed that after strong protest to America through diplomatic channels failed to sway the plan, Beijing responded with threats with military actions. The People’s Liberation Army notified the U.S. Department of Defense that it would not allow Craft’s visit to damage China’s national interests. The army’s fighter jets would follow the U.S. charter flight into Taiwan’s airspace to assert its jurisdiction over the self-ruled island, the Chinese military warned, adding it would not rule out opening fire if it faced obstruction from the Taiwanese military.

(March 15, 2021) Iran released images and film footage on Monday of what it said was a new Revolutionary Guards base armed with cruise and ballistic missiles and “electronic warfare” equipment. A report on state TV described the base as a “missile city” and showed rows of what looked like missiles in a depot with cement walls. It did not give any details on its location. Alireza Tangsiri, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards’ naval unit, told state TV the base had equipment to detect enemy signals. The report said the base’s “electronic warfare equipment” included radar, monitoring, simulation and disruption systems. Last year, the Guards force said it had built a number of underground “missile cities” along the Gulf coastline. (Iran releases footage of Revolutionary Guards 'missile city' base — Reuters) <br>

(March 14, 2021) Reforms to Hong Kong’s electoral laws are expected to take place in May, a senior Hong Kong politician said after China’s top legislature decided that the city’s election system needs to be “improved” to ensure patriots are in power. Tam emphasized that those who wish to enter the Legislative Council to “make trouble” or to overthrow or subvert the government will not be allowed to run for election. The NPC Standing Committee is expected to soon amend the annexes of the Basic Law related to election systems, which will then require local legislation to be amended in Hong Kong.

(March 13, 2021) The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday designated five Chinese tech firms as posing an "unacceptable risk" to national security. The companies include Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, along with ZTE, Hytera Communications, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology. The US may work with international partners to deal with not only  Chinese tech, but also other issues such as Beijing's human rights abuses against the Uighur minority and it aggressive stance toward territorial waters in the South China Sea.

(March 12, 2021) "Chances are the harassment by Chinese Coast Guard assets will be more serious than that of Chinese military planes," said Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst at the government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research, at the forum. That's because "Coast Guard ships operate with more flexibility due to their supposed civilian nature" and can carry out "gray zone" tactics, which refer to moves by a state to achieve its objectives but that are less likely to cause a military conflict, Su warned. Incidents in which Chinese Coast Guard ships used excessive force while operating in waters claimed by China, such as waters near Vietnam and Malaysia, have been common in the past, according to Su. According to the Foreign Ministry, more than 100 incidents of "harassment" by Chinese warplanes were recorded around Taiwan in 2020, involving 1,807 sorties. Although the region has yet to see the Chinese Coast Guard actually enforce the new law, it is a common practice of Beijing to make a law that exerts pressure on other countries and implement it later when the time is right, Akio Yaita, a Japanese journalist, said at the forum.

The project was meant to further increase internet bandwidth between the U.S. and Hong Kong. The failed plan could hamper Hong Kong’s bid in becoming an information hub in the region, Francis Fong, president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, told Apple Daily. It might also hinder investor confidence, with Facebook’s move seen as a symbolic no-confidence vote in the city’s business and security environment.

(March 11, 2021) Mathias Bölinger, a DW journalist based in China, said while the situation in China has deteriorated over the last few years, it has dramatically worsened over the last year. “It has become harder to find interviewees and scheduled interviews are often cancelled,” Bölinger said. He added that Chinese people are less willing to talk about political topics and are often warned not to give interviews to foreign journalists. Foreign correspondents are also facing more and more restrictions in other aspects. Steffen Wurzel, a Shanghai-based correspondent for the ARD, also pointed out to DW that the working conditions for foreign journalists in China have deteriorated dramatically in the last year. He said the biggest problem is that almost all topics have been highly politicized by the Chinese leadership during the coronavirus outbreak. “Despite what China says about wanting to be open to the world and to show everybody what a vibrant society it is, they clearly restrict reporting of anything that doesn’t adhere to their vision,” Steven Lee Myers, Beijing bureau chief for the New York Times told the FCCC. "It’s suggestive of a climate that’s not going to get any better." (Foreign correspondents in China face growing restrictions — DW News) <br>

(March 11, 2021) The architects of Hong Kong's Basic Law wanted to ensure stability and prosperity in Hong Kong with the principle of one country, two systems.

Upcoming talks in Alaska between Blinken and top Chinese diplomats Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi would not result in anything but each side speaking on its own, Sang Pu said.

(March 10, 2021) Taiwan has arrested four people in an investigation into a Beijing-based bitcoin company for stealthily poaching hundreds of engineers and threatening the island’s all-important semiconductor industry. Bitmain Technology Ltd was said to have set up two subsidiaries in Taiwan in 2017 to conduct research and development into artificial intelligence chips while hiding their background as mainland-funded entities.

There would be little buffer time for Taiwan’s military if Beijing launched its attack from the two airports, said Su Tzu-yun, director of the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan. Beijing would also be able to evade satellite surveillance if it used high-speed rail to transport troops to Longtian and Hui’an, Su added.

(March 9, 2021) At least 98 people have died from injuries sustained in a series of explosions in Equatorial Guinea, the health ministry said on Monday after volunteers searched the rubble for bodies. "Because the damages are not only physical but also mental," the ministry said. A fire near a weapons depot at the city's Nkoantoma Military Base is believed to have caused the blasts. He said the explosion had damaged nearly all homes and buildings in Bata, a city with just over 200,000 residents, adding that he had ordered a probe to hold those responsible to account.

(March 6, 2021) The US is expressing growing concern over a hack on Microsoft's Exchange email software that the tech company has blamed on China. "This is an active threat," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday. "Everyone running these servers - government, private sector, academia - needs to act now to patch them." Microsoft said hackers had used its mail server to attack their targets. It is reported that tens of thousands of US organisations may be impacted. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributed the attacks with "high confidence" to a "state-sponsored threat actor" based in China which they named Hafnium. Although Hafnium is based in China, it allegedly conducts its operations primarily from leased virtual private servers in the US, Microsoft said.

(March 5, 2021) The United States condemns China’s “continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular news briefing. Price called Beijing’s moves “a direct attack on Hong Kong’s autonomy ... freedoms and the democratic processes.” “I don’t think anyone is satisfied yet, with the international response to what has taken place in Xinjiang. And that’s precisely why we are, in many ways, galvanizing the world, galvanizing collective action, to make clear that these sort of abuses against human rights in Xinjiang and elsewhere will not be tolerated,” he said.

(March 5, 2021) The World Uyghur Congress accused the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of ignoring an ethics complaint it filed last year to move the 2022 Winter Games out of Beijing due to China's alleged human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities. "The IOC can no longer hide behind 'political neutrality' to justify its decision to host the games in a country that is currently committing genocide and crimes against humanity," Dolkun said Friday. "Real people are suffering from these crimes every day and the Olympics and the sponsors risk being forever tainted with the intense suffering of my people."

(March 4, 2021) The NPC meeting runs in parallel to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a meeting of the most powerful political advisory body in the country. That already began on Thursday, and collectively the gatherings are referred to as the "Two Sessions". We will also see the NPC formally approve the 14th Five-Year-Plan that was announced at the end of last year. China is the only major economy in the world that publishes a five-year policy plan, and it has been doing so since 1953. Such actions, he said, "can bring companies such as Huawei to their knees, and constrain future economic growth as well as the strength of Chinese industry." But many in Hong Kong and rights groups have accused China of eroding those freedoms and autonomy in recent years. There were months of violent protests in 2019. China scrapped presidential term limits in 2018, which would allow Mr Xi to remain beyond his two terms. (China set to overhaul HK electoral system — BBC) <br>

(March 4, 2021) This issue has long preoccupied Beijing, said Caroline Meinhardt, a research associate at the Berlin-based China research institute MERICS. But following this strategy means the government faces a challenge in the long run, she added. "Significantly strengthening demand-led growth would require a significant redistribution of income to ordinary households," the expert told DW. Nis Grünberg, a colleague of Meinhardt's at MERICS, said: "The focus in the coming years will be on strengthening the country's own economy and industry, and expanding social systems, especially in health and education." As planned, the victory over poverty comes in the 100th year of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. "However, the task now is to raise the hundreds of millions of Chinese living in precarious economic and employment conditions to a middle-class standard of living, and to combat growing inequality," Grünberg said. "More investment in education and the creation of jobs, also outside urban centers, will be necessary to maintain the standard achieved." "At the moment, China is still far from becoming technologically independent," Meinhardt said. "Thanks to enormous government support and private investment, China is likely to produce significant achievements in some subsectors in the coming years," she added. ... Climate policy is the only area where President Xi Jinping can currently win friends and allies on the international stage, especially in the West. Pointing to the pandemic, authorities postponed elections to the Hong Kong Legislative Council by over a year. They are now expected to take place by December.

(March 4, 2021) Zhang Yesui, a spokesman for the National People’s Congress, said on Thursday it had the constitutional power to “improve” Hong Kong’s system and a draft decision would be discussed during the annual parliamentary session which opens on Friday. Most of the main pro-democracy politicians and activists are either in jail or in exile after authorities cracked down on the mass anti-government protests of 2019, culminating with the imposition of a national security law last year. Hong Kong’s Cable TV and Now TV, citing unnamed sources, said after Zhang spoke the changes would include increasing the size of an election committee to select Hong Kong’s leader from 1,200 to 1,500, and the city’s legislature from 70 to 90 seats. Currently only half of the 70 seats in the Legislative Council are directly elected, a proportion which is likely to shrink once the new changes are implemented. The moves will reduce democratic representation in both the Legislative Council and the election committee, which must convene before Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s five-year term ends in July next year.

(March 4, 2021) Announcing a new executive order paving the way for sanctions on the generals and their businesses, Biden said on Feb. 10 that the United States was taking steps to prevent the generals from “improperly having access” to $1 billion in Myanmar government funds. Two sources told Reuters the executive order was designed to provide the New York Fed with the legal authority to hold the $1 billion of Myanmar reserves indefinitely. An attempt to empty the account was made on Feb. 4, but was blocked automatically by processes that had been put in place at the New York Fed before the coup, two of the sources said. One source said that was because transactions involving Myanmar require extra scrutiny as the country last year was placed on the international Financial Action Task Force’s “gray list” for money laundering concerns, in part because of the risk of proceeds from drug trafficking being washed through its banks.

(March 4, 2021) The spending figure, set at 1.35 trillion yuan ($208.47 billion) in the national budget released on Friday, is closely watched as a barometer of how aggressively the country will beef up its military. Military spending accounts for around 1.3% of China’s total GDP, far lower than the United States, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-backed Global Times, tweeted.

(March 3, 2021) China is the only country with the power to seriously challenge the U.S. ability to shape the global system of “rules, values and relationships,” he said. “Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be,” Blinken said. Engaging with China “from a position of strength,” as the administration seeks to do, “requires standing up for our values when human rights are abused in Xinjiang or when democracy is trampled in Hong Kong, because if we don’t, China will act with even greater impunity,” Blinken said.

(March 2, 2021) But our evidence suggests that - alongside the re-education camps built across Xinjiang in recent years - the policy involves a high risk of coercion and is similarly designed to assimilate minorities by changing their lifestyles and thinking. The video report, broadcast by China's Communist Party-run news channel, shows a group of officials in the centre of the village, sitting under a red banner advertising jobs in Anhui Province, 4,000km away. After two full days, the reporter's narration says, not a single person from the village has come forward to sign up, and so the officials begin moving from house to house. What follows is some of the most compelling footage of China's massive campaign to transfer Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang into factory and manual labouring jobs, often considerable distances from their homes. "The Chinese government continually says that people are volunteering to engage in these programmes, but this absolutely reveals that this is a system of coercion that people are not allowed to resist." This overarching goal of assimilating Uighurs into China's majority Han culture is made clear by an in-depth Chinese study of Xinjiang's job-transfer scheme, circulated to senior Chinese officials and seen by the BBC. Written by a group of academics from Nankai University in the Chinese city of Tianjin, it concludes that the mass labour transfers are "an important method to influence, meld and assimilate Uighur minorities" and bring about a "transformation of their thinking." The Huafu Textile Company is located on the edge of a grey industrial estate in the city of Huaibei, in China's eastern province of Anhui. Amazon told the BBC that it does not tolerate the use of forced labour and that where it finds products that do not meet its supply chain standards, it removes them from sale. Interviews recorded at the scene suggest the Uighur workers were free to leave the factory during their leisure time, but at other factories visited for the research, the evidence was more mixed.

(March 2, 2021) The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which oversees a system for countries to share recognition of patents, said China filed 68,720 applications last year while the United States filed 59,230. Daren Tang, WIPO director-general, said the rise in Chinese filings was part of a longer-term trend for higher applications from Asia more broadly, with South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia all submitting more applications last year. Unlike after the 2008 financial crisis when filings fell sharply, overall filings via WIPO’s system were up 4% overall in 2020 to a new record despite the COVID-19-induced slowdown, it said. Singapore’s Tang began his term in October and received strong support from Western countries including the United States in a highly politicised race against a Chinese candidate for the top job last year.
