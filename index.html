(January 24, 2021) Taiwan and the US have warned China after it flew nuclear-capable bombers and fighters over Taiwanese airspace. The US has urged China to stop pressuring Taiwan. "We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with the nation's democratically elected representatives," said State Department spokesman Ned Price.

(January 24, 2021) The JL-3, the country’s most advanced submarine-launched long-range missile, is projected to be fully integrated with the PLA’s next generation of submarines in 2025, but China has not officially confirmed that it is even under development. Nevertheless, it is still a threat and one of a number of missiles that could put the People’s Liberation Army within striking distance of the continental United States, according to an American military report.

(January 24, 2021) The 10 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists jailed in mainland China might soon be visited by their families after being held incommunicado for over six months, although a human rights lawyer said the visits would likely be infrequent. The detention facility will have the final say on the arrangements regarding family visits, Ren added. Apple Daily contacted the Yantian detention center, the Shenzhen prison and the Shenzhen Municipal Justice Bureau for details about visits, but all calls went unanswered.

(January 24, 2021) This move by the DFC is not economic as much as political. Ecuador’s development is secondary. What is primary is the US desire to remove Chinese businesses and political influence from Latin America. Part of the assault on China by the US government has been to paint its loans to Ecuador as predatory. These loans, the US officials say, create a “debt trap” and Boehler said they leave Ecuador at the mercy of a “single authoritarian country.” The US government money, on the other hand, came with substantial claims on the government of Ecuador’s policy orientation. Quito has had to sign up for Washington’s “Clean Network,” a US State Department project to force countries to build telecommunications networks without a Chinese telecom provider involved in them. This particularly applies to the high-speed fifth-generation (5G) networks. Ecuador pre-emptively joined the Clean Network in November 2020. This opened the door for the DFC loan to Ecuador. (US rescue of Ecuador from Chinese debt is a trap — Asia Times) <br>

(January 24, 2021) When Berners-Lee first devised the World Wide Web in 1989, he effectively gave away the idea and associated software for free, to ensure nobody would or could charge for using its protocols. Part of the issue here is Google and Facebook don’t just collect a list of interesting links to news content. Rather the way they find, sort, curate and present news content adds value for their users. They don’t just link to news content, they reframe it. It is often in that reframing that advertisements appear, and this is where these platforms make money. Another huge challenge for media businesses is that increasing numbers of users are taking headlines and previews at face value, without necessarily reading the article. This can obviously decrease revenue for news providers, as well as perpetuate misinformation. Indeed, it’s one of the reasons Twitter began asking users to actually read content before retweeting it. If we accept most of the additional value platforms provide to their users is in curating and providing previews of content, then deleting the second element (which just specifies linking to content) would fix Berners-Lee’s concerns. It would ensure the use of links alone can’t be monetised, as has always been true on the web. Platforms would still need to pay when they present users with extracts or previews of articles, but not when they only link to it. (Australia’s media bargaining code could break the Internet — Asia Times) <br>

(January 23, 2021) A year from now, Beijing will host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. Beijing 2022 will take place not only under the shadow of Covid-19, but as the most politically charged Olympics since the 1936 Berlin Games in Nazi Germany. Beijing 2022 is shaping up to be the most controversial Olympics since the US-led boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Games. Beijing 2022 will not be business as usual. The Covid-19 pandemic casts doubt as to how the Games will be held, and it is looking more and more like international spectators may not be allowed, especially given China’s clampdown on recent Covid outbreaks. Beijing will be the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games. This milestone will mark China’s transition from a nascent to a bona-fide superpower; from Deng Xiaoping’s strategy of “hide your strength and bide your time” to Xi Jinping’s call for the “Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.” China’s approach to security is an extension of its Covid-19 strategy: namely, to isolate, trace and eliminate anything of consequence that is at odds with its interests.  China uses its impressive AI and social media monitoring prowess to detect and isolate non-conformity and dissent. The authorities then trace those involved and neutralize or eliminate the virus – or, in this case, the perceived threat. As regards cybersecurity, there is no expectation of privacy in China. The Chinese government has the capability to monitor phones, tablets, and computers connected to the Internet, and they regularly monitor private email and internet browsing. “It has just become pretty impossible to [report] in China today. Now there is so much government control and fear among ordinary people at speaking to foreign media and especially American media … that I’ve found that people will not talk anymore…. It increasingly feels like living in North Korea.” She goes on to say that she wouldn’t currently travel to China if she were American, Australian, Canadian or even British due to concerns over arbitrary detention. One also has to feel sorry for the thousands of athletes with Olympic aspirations who in the pandemic environment have had difficulty training, and who will also be denied the opportunity to practice at the Beijing 2022 venues. But despite the veneer of normality that the pageantry of Beijing 2022 will provide, the Games will take place under an oppressive security blanket in a time of unprecedented crisis. (Beijing braces for perfect storm of Olympic woes — Asia Times) <br>

(January 23, 2021) The Yarlung Zangbao Dam plan is moving ahead without China discussing or entering into water-sharing agreements with downstream India or Bangladesh. Some analysts believe China is using its leverage over water flows as a stick to win concessions from downstream Southeast Asian states on other issues, including in regard to its Belt and Road Initiative. It’s possible China is trying to establish a similar dynamic with India with its Yarlung Zangbao Dam designs. In the first week of January, in apparent response, New Delhi announced a series of new road-building projects in Arunachal, evidently meant to strengthen India’s hold of the China-claimed territory. Since the confrontation in Ladakh, India has also established more outposts along the 1,126-kilometer line of actual control that separates Arunachal from China-controlled Tibet. Over the decades, Tibetans in their droves have fled to and now reside in India, not least Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama. Some analysts have speculated India could play a “Tibet card” to stir instability in Tibet if relations deteriorate significantly. (China risks a Himalayan water war with India — Asia Times) <br>

(January 23, 2021) An online anti-Communist summit hosted on Zoom by overseas Chinese dissidents was delayed and disrupted after coming under sustained attack by trolls, not the first time the video-conferencing app has proved useful to Beijing. As the conference started, trolls entered the chat room and made numerous criticisms of the event. The event was delayed for 2 ½ hours as the participants had to switch chat rooms several times. Records of the attacks were sent to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI, Wang said. In May last year, Zoom shut accounts of exiled dissidents Zhou Fengsuo and others after they used the platform to host a forum commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre.

(January 23, 2021) Eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Saturday, and Taiwan’s air force deployed missiles to “monitor” the incursion, the island’s Defence Ministry said. The presence of so many Chinese combat aircraft on this mission - Taiwan said it was made up of eight nuclear-capable H-6K bombers and four J-16 fighter jets - is unusual.

他還要做篇文章，叫做〈原道〉，真正原到道反面去了！他說：『君不出令，則失其為君；民不出粟、米、絲、麻以奉其上，則誅。』如此說去，那桀、紂很會出令的，又很會誅民的，然則桀、紂之為君是，而桀、紂之民全非了，豈不是是非顛倒嗎？他卻又要闢佛、老，倒又與和尚做朋友。所以後世學儒的人，覺得孔、孟的道理太費事，不如弄兩句闢佛、老的口頭禪，就算是聖人之徒，豈不省事。弄的朱夫子也出不了這個範圍，只好據韓昌黎的〈原道〉去改孔子的《論語》，把那『攻乎異端』的『攻』字，百般扭捏，究竟總說不圓，卻把孔、孟的儒教被宋儒弄的小而又小，以至於絕了！ (劉鶚, 老殘遊記 第九回, 1903) <br>

(January 22, 2021) Hong Kong is preparing to lock down thousands of residents in a bid to contain a worsening outbreak of the coronavirus, local media outlets reported on Friday (Jan 22), citing unidentified people. The lockdown is expected to begin this weekend, and involve 150 residential buildings in Yau Tsim Mong, the core urban district of Kowloon, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) said. It will affect between 4,000 and 9,000 residents, covering a mandatory testing area where ageing buildings and subdivided flats populated by lower-income families are common.

(January 22, 2021) Beijing launched mass Covid-19 testing in some areas on Friday (Jan 22), while Shanghai was testing all hospital staff, as China battles its worst outbreak of the disease since March and families fret over reunion plans for the Lunar New Year amid new curbs. Of these new cases, 94 were local transmissions: north-eastern Heilongjiang reported 47 new cases, while Jilin province reported 19 new cases. Shanghai reported six new cases, while the capital Beijing reported three new cases. (Beijing launches coronavirus mass testing as daily tally drops slightly — Strait Times) <br>

(January 22, 2021) A Christian villager in China’s Henan province was fined 160,000 yuan (US$24,700) for celebrating Christmas with fellow believers. The bureau issued the fine to Niu on Wednesday, citing article 71 of the Regulation on Religious Affairs which bans aiding of “illegal religious activities.” Niu had three days to file an application for an appeal hearing. The regulation does not recognize home churches, and any self-organized Christain activities are illegal, according to Weiquanwang.

(January 22, 2021) Two civil rights advocates who were held in Chinese custody for about a year finally met with their attorneys and were said to have been ill-treated. Legal academic Xu Zhiyong was allegedly allowed just two to four hours of sleep on some days; he received only a Chinese steamed bun during mealtimes and had to pay for other food. Beijing-based human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi was similarly subjected to sleep deprivation, and was limited to drinking about 600 milliliters of water a day, according to the attorneys. Both Xu and Ding are leading figures in the New Citizens’ Movement, a civil rights group that has called for constitutional reform and criticised government corruption. Xu once penned a letter urging Chinese President Xi Jinping to step down over COVID-19. (Chinese legal scholar, rights lawyer ‘deprived of sleep and food’ in year-long detention — Apple Daily) <br>

(January 21, 2021) President Xi Jinping and other leaders will join more than 130 graft-busters at annual conference of Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Several senior cadres have been sentenced in corruption cases recently, including Lai Xiaomin who was handed the death penalty for taking bribes.

(January 21, 2021) Half of the CPEC’s funds, or over $30 billion, are earmarked for the energy sector. Several Chinese IPPs have been involved in the construction of as many as 27 power plants in Pakistan with a total installed capacity of 12,000 MW under the CPEC program. The report revealed that most of the IPPs, including those set up under the CPEC arrangement, had defied the government policy and made 50 to 70% profits, as against the 15% maximum determined by the regulatory authority with dollar indexation. The report traced 100 billion rupees ($625 million) in annual over-payment to the IPPs and discussed the magnitude of illegal “profiteering” of Chinese energy companies. Transmission and distribution losses, overdue payments, and theft and pilferage of electricity also power up the debts that threaten to keep the lights out in Pakistan. (China’s role in knocking the lights off in Pakistan — Asia Times) <br>

(April 15, 2019) Hu had a fatal heart attack during a Politburo meeting in China, then died a week later, on April 15, 1989. An economic reformer and close ally of Deng Xiaoping, Hu had led the efforts to launch China into capitalism and to recover from the years under Mao Zedong. “We are now entering the most politically fraught period of 2019,” Bill Bishop, publisher of the widely read Sinocism newsletter, wrote in a column for Axios on Friday. “Expect everything to be on even more of a lockdown than it usually is, and that includes in the economy and the markets.” About 20 people, including Hu’s sons, traveled to the Huyaobang Cemetery in Gongqingcheng (literally “Communist Youth League City”) in Jiangxi province for an exhibition to “preserve Red memory,” according to local reports. Police officers kept a close watch on them. Many young Chinese will know little, if anything, about Hu’s role. All but the most anodyne references to events related to Tiananmen Square are scrubbed from China’s history textbooks, and all discussion of it is censored on the Chinese Internet. This is partly because Hu’s campaign against corruption is helpful now for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president who has led an exhaustive campaign against graft that has led to the imprisonment of 1.5 million officials in the six years since he took power. But reminding Chinese today of Hu’s legacy is a risky business, Huang continued. It “is a reminder to many Chinese of the political reforms which have stalled since his death.” (His death 30 years ago today was the spark for the Tiananmen Square protests — Washington Post) <br>

(Feb. 17, 1984) But one of the marshal's grandsons, Zhu Guohua, was executed for rape in Tianjin in October, according to Chinese officials. And a report from Hong Kong early this month said another grandson, Zhu Yuanchao, was spared the death penalty for serious economic crimes only because some Chinese felt it would insult the great marshal's memory to execute two of his progeny. The punishments were part of a renewed effort to discourage flagrant misbehavior by the children of ''cadres,'' or Government and party officials, who flaunt a life of privilege in an ostensibly classless society. ''They think they can get away with anything,'' one man said. ''In general, the parents will even shelter the crimes of their children.'' Such young people are called ''huahua gongzi,'' a disparaging Chinese term meaning playboys. They attend special kindergartens, grow up in spacious homes, ride in cars assigned to their parents and shop at special stores closed to the public. On weekends, they hang out in restaurants that ordinary youths have trouble entering. They get cushy jobs or go on to higher education through the connections of their parents. There is too much entrenched resistance to dismantle the perquisites of power, but the authorities have become less resitant about prosecuting children of officials who violate the law. Last September, The Economic Daily related how two sons of senior officials in Jiangxi Province were sent to jail after they beat up half a dozen people. The newspaper said it took more than four months for the two to be punished because their parents obstructed the efforts. (CHINA CRACKING DOWN ON PROGENY OF POWERFUL — NY Times) <br>

(January 20, 2021) Mr Biden is to enact a range of measures to help tackle Covid-19, which has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the US. The president's executive orders will: Cease action to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO); Centralise the national Covid-19 response in a move to co-ordinate the distribution of protective equipment, vaccines and tests. Mr Biden seeks to undo some of his predecessor's controversial orders relating to environmental policy by: Rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement, from which Mr Trump formally withdrew the US last year; Cancelling the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which environmentalists and Native American groups have fought for more than a decade. The president has vowed to: Revoke Mr Trump's so-called Muslim ban, that restricted entry into the country from some primarily Muslim countries; Stop the construction of the Mexican border wall. He also declined, for now, to take other executive actions, like cancelling student loan debt, lifting Mr Trump's trade restrictions or enacting new criminal justice measures.

Mr Blinken was asked at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday if he agreed with Mr Pompeo's announcement, to which he answered: "That would be my judgment as well." Mr Biden's team made a similar allegation last August, saying the Uighurs had suffered "unspeakable oppression... at the hands of China's authoritarian government". China says it is fighting "three evil forces" of separatism, terrorism, and extremism in the far western region of Xinjiang, where most of the 11 million Uighurs live. It says its "training measures" in Xinjiang are necessary to combat these. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate the Uighur culture, by forcing Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol.

(January 19, 2021) Thousands of prefabricated rooms fill a vast field on the outskirts of China's Shijiazhuang city as construction crews work round the clock to erect a large quarantine facility to curb the city's growing Covid-19 outbreak. The facility is expected to have enough rooms to hold more than 4,000 people once it is completed, CCTV said on Tuesday (Jan 19). More than 20,000 residents of villages in the surrounding Hebei province have been sent into quarantine in centralised facilities, state media reported last week. Meanwhile, millions of local residents have been tested for the virus multiple times. (Chinese city rushes to build massive Covid-19 quarantine centre — Strait Times) <br>

The latter is getting close to “extreme bubble” territory. “Just 25 doses have been given in one lowest income country — not 25 million, not 25,000 — just 25. I need to be blunt: The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure.” That was the World Health Organization’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. California’s state epidemiologist has advised halting the rollout of more than 300,000 doses of biotech Moderna’s MRNA, -0.05% vaccine, after possible allergic reactions by some recipients.

(January 19, 2021) Just one day before the inauguration, the incoming Biden administration said it will reject U.S. president Donald Trump’s move to lift coronavirus-related travel bans on non-American arrivals from much of Europe, the U.K. and Brazil. However, hours later, Jen Psaki, Biden’s press secretary, said the incoming administration will block Trump’s plan. According to Reuters, Trump’s decision to rescind the travel restrictions has won support from COVID-19 task force members and public health officials.

(January 15, 2021) In particular, we urge the WHO to press the government of China to address the following: Illnesses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), WIV Research on “RaTG13” and “gain of function”, Secret WIV Links to Military Research. ... China instead refused offers of help – including from the United States – and punished brave Chinese doctors, scientists, and journalists who tried to alert the world to the dangers of the virus. Until the CCP allows a full and thorough accounting of what happened in Wuhan, it is only a matter of time until China births another pandemic and inflicts it on the Chinese people, and the world. (Ensuring a Transparent, Thorough Investigation of COVID-19’s Origin — Department of State) <br>

(January 15, 2021) For more than a year, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has systematically prevented a transparent and thorough investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic’s origin, choosing instead to devote enormous resources to deceit and disinformation. The CCP’s deadly obsession with secrecy and control comes at the expense of public health in China and around the world. 1. The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses. The CCP has prevented independent journalists, investigators, and global health authorities from interviewing researchers at the WIV, including those who were ill in the fall of 2019. 2. The WIV has a published record of conducting “gain-of-function” research to engineer chimeric viruses. But the WIV has not been transparent or consistent about its record of studying viruses most similar to the COVID-19 virus, including “RaTG13,” which it sampled from a cave in Yunnan Province in 2013 after several miners died of SARS-like illness. As part of a thorough inquiry, they must have a full accounting of why the WIV altered and then removed online records of its work with RaTG13 and other viruses. 3. For many years the United States has publicly raised concerns about China’s past biological weapons work, which Beijing has neither documented nor demonstrably eliminated, despite its clear obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention. 3. The WIV has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017. The United States and other donors who funded or collaborated on civilian research at the WIV have a right and obligation to determine whether any of our research funding was diverted to secret Chinese military projects at the WIV.

(September 25, 2020) Beijing is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases; the largest source of marine debris; the worst perpetrators of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; and the world’s largest consumer of trafficked wildlife and timber products.  Tragically, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represses civil society and a free press, slowing changes that would benefit its citizens and people all over the world.

“Nevertheless, the prodigious edifice still remains incomplete. The press, that giant machine, which incessantly pumps all the intellectual sap of society, belches forth without pause fresh materials for its work. The whole human race is on the scaffoldings. Each mind is a mason. The humblest fills his hole, or places his stone. Rétif de La Bretonne brings his hod of plaster. Every day a new course rises. Independently of the original and individual contribution of each writer, there are collective contingents. The eighteenth century gives the Encyclopedia, the revolution gives the Moniteur.” (Victor Hugo, Notre-Dame de Paris, Book 5 Chapter 2, 1831) <br>

(January 18, 2021) China's economy grew 2.3% in 2020, as the world's second-largest economy showed recovery in the fourth quarter, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. It was China's slowest economic expansion in more than four decades since the communist country embarked on major economic reforms in the 1970s. The following quarter, after the country's authorities declared a victory over the virus in March and reopened the economy, China became the first major world economy to grow again with a 3.2% expansion. Growth was aided by global demand for Chinese-made masks and other medical supplies. The country's exports rose 3.6% last year despite a tariff war with the US. The country's latest trade figures show exports in December rose by 18.1% compared to the same month last year, Beijing's customs authority announced last week. At the same time, imports increased by 6.5%. (China's economic growth slowest in 4 decades amid pandemic — DW News) <br>

(January 18, 2021) A caravan of thousands of migrants clashed on Sunday with Guatemalan authorities while continuing to trek toward the U.S. border, according to reports. Estimates range from 6,000 to 8,000 migrants who have entered Guatemala over the weekend. In contrast, only around 3,000 Guatemalan officers mustered to hold up the caravan in the Sunday morning clash, according to Reuters. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had promised Trump that he would halt undocumented immigrants, increasing the attention and investment along Mexico’s southern border, according to Bloomberg.

(January 17, 2021) A Chinese military aircraft entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Sunday, the seventh consecutive day there has been such an incursion, according to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND). China's People's Liberation Army has deployed military aircraft in Taiwan's ADIZ every day in January except for Jan. 1, Jan. 8 and Jan. 10, according to MND records. Aircraft used by Chinese military for such maneuvers were all spy planes or signal jamming planes, MND records showed.

(January 17, 2021) Lin argued that through the revisions, Beijing has laid the groundwork for giving legal legitimacy to launching a war. One of the revisions added the term "development interests" to a provision permitting Beijing to "defend its national interests and development interests, and resolve differences with the use of force," he said, giving China a wider scope for using force. Judging from current international circumstances, the phrase "development interests" encompasses the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and Diaoyutai (Senkaku) Islands issues, non-traditional threats, overseas interests, and security in space and on the internet, Lin said.

(January 16, 2021) The top leadership sees control over this narrative as vital to its hold over the Chinese population and the boosting of its international reputation. A former lawyer, Zhang travelled to Wuhan in February to talk to people about how they were coping in lockdown. She shared videos and talked about what she observed, at one point noting the fear people felt toward the government was greater than their fear of the virus. While Xi emphasised in a 2013 speech the importance of the propaganda and “ideological leadership” to the country, the pandemic has allowed China’s party-state to extend its ideological control over the courts, eliminating any pretence of judicial autonomy. In essence, the Communist Party is the rule of law, with Chinese characteristics. This domestic political context makes it unlikely the WHO researchers will be allowed to fully investigate all hypotheses as to the origins of the coronavirus, such as the claim it could have been caused by a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to the documents, published by the Associated Press this month, the government is monitoring scientists’ findings and requiring any research to be approved by a new task force under Xi’s direct command before publication.

(January 16, 2021) In recent days, Iran has released new videos of both the killing of Soleimani in the U.S. drone strike ordered by President Trump and of the ballistic missile barrage fired into Iraq last year. In December, more than 20 rockets were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the largest attack on the American diplomatic compound in a decade, officials said. There was concern Iran would strike again in the days leading up to the one-year anniversary of the U.S. killing of Soleimani.

(January 15, 2021) The Hong Kong-listed Xiaomi was on Thursday added to the Donald Trump administration’s list of “Chinese Communist military companies” on the grounds that it was deemed to have directly or indirectly operated to support the modernization of the People’s Liberation Army of China. The article revealed that products and technologies from Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Xiaomi, Lenovo and other Chinese enterprises had been used in the research, production and repair of weapons and equipment for the military. The Beijing Kingsoft Office was among Chinese companies listed by the Trump administration in early January for sanctions over national security concerns.

Under the new order, the CBP will detain all U.S.-bound cotton and tomato products grown or produced out of Xinjiang, ranging from canned sauce to clothing. Beijing has said it takes necessary national security measures against Islamic extremism in its approach to the Uyghurs.

(January 14, 2021) One year after signing the phase one trade deal with the US, China remains far behind in its commitment to buy more American goods, though the agreement has been a vital sticking plaster in a fast deteriorating bilateral relationship, experts said. The world’s two largest economies signed the deal on January 15 last year, effectively calling a ceasefire in a trade war that saw tariffs slapped on billions of dollars worth of products and reorganised global supply chains after it was launched by the US in July 2018.

(January 14, 2021) When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%,, although that is still not as pronounced as in 2009. There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Germany is a leading exporter, in particular of manufactured goods, and sales abroad fell by 10%. Those declines were partly offset by an increase in construction. There was also an increase in government spending, as Berlin sought to limit the extent of the economic damage. Many of the other developed economies which were more affected in public health terms - including the UK, France, Italy and Spain - are likely to report significantly deeper contractions for 2020 when figures are published in the coming weeks.

(January 14, 2021) Two members of a World Health Organization team investigating the origins of the coronavirus did not board a flight to China after testing positive for Covid-19 antibodies, the UN agency said on Thursday. The two scientists were negative for the standard nucleic acid test used to diagnose active infection, but tested positive for IgM antibodies, which may point to recent infection. WHO guidance, however, says antibody tests should not be used to diagnose acute Covid-19 infection, as antibodies develop a few weeks after infection.

(January 14, 2021) US President Donald Trump condemned the violent attack on the Capitol building last week and urged Americans to be united in a video released on Wednesday, hours after being impeached for "incitement of insurrection." "I want to be very clear; I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement," he said in his first remarks since the House of Representatives voted to impeach him for the second time. "Today in a bipartisan way the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States," the top Democrat in Congress said at the signing ceremony. "The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and dangerous," he said. "What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, and not to silence one another."

(January 14, 2021) The Chinese Communist Party is actively shaping the narrative of its history ahead of its 100th anniversary. The presence of Sun at the meeting showed the CCP’s determination to control the coverage of its centenary and history. Wang is instructing media outlets to paper over the negative aspects in the party’s history, including widespread corruption, the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen massacre, and shift attention to the economic achievements and poverty alleviation under the leadership of Xi. The new narrative serves to support the theory that Xi’s “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” is tailor-made for the country and cannot be subjected to challenges.

(January 13, 2021) None of the police officers who were alleged to have used excessive force during the 2019 protests have been held accountable, the report also noted. The Chinese government bypassed local legislature to enact the law, which “creates specialized secret security agencies, denies people fair trial rights, provides sweeping new powers to the police, increases restraints on civil society and the media, and weakens judicial oversight,” it said. The law was in fact a “Communist Party Security Law” to silence lawmakers and other Hongkongers fighting for democracy, with many having been jailed or forced to go into exile since the legislation’s enactment, said HRW Executive Director Kenneth Roth. Countries across the globe have started to understand that China’s human rights breaches harm the whole world, said Sophie Richardson, the China director of HRW.

(January 12, 2021) Hong Kong authorities have started sending phones and other digital devices confiscated from political suspects to mainland Chinese counterparts, as the advanced technology on the other side can be used to break into the gadgets and extract information for investigation, United States media says.

They called each of the numbers and found three iPhones lying around his home. For example, the Telegram account of Tam Tak-chi, of the radical democratic party People Power, was found to have been reactivated despite confirmation from a colleague of Tam’s who managed his social media platform that the activist had been in detention since September and had not restarted any Telegram account. The social media or email accounts of former lawmakers Raymond Chan, Lam Cheuk-ting and Helena Wong were also suspected to have been compromised.

(January 12, 2021) Huawei's patent was originally filed in July 2018, in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Sciences . It describes ways to use deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques to identify various features of pedestrians photographed or filmed in the street. "Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination," he said. The patent was brought to light by the video-surveillance research group IPVM. It had previously flagged a separate "confidential" document on Huawei's website, referencing work on a "Uighur alert" system. On Wednesday, Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the UK Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee and leads the Conservative Party's China Research Group, told BBC News: "Chinese tech giants supporting the brutal assault on the Uighur population show us why we as consumers and as a society must be careful with who we buy our products from or award business to. "Developing ethnic-labelling technology for use by a repressive regime is clearly not behaviour that lives up to our standards." IPVM also discovered references to Uighur people in patents filed by the Chinese artificial-intelligence company Sensetime and image-recognition specialist Megvii. "Any company that sells video-surveillance software and systems to the Chinese police would have to ensure that they meet the police's requirements, which includes the capacity for ethnicity detection," Ms Wang said.

(Accessed January 12, 2021) He came up with an idea for hybridizing rice in the 1960s when a series of harmful political policies (such as the Great Leap Forward) had plunged China into an unprecedented famine that caused the deaths of millions of Chinese citizens. In 1970, he found a particularly important species of wild rice that he ended up using for the creation of a high-yield hybrid rice species. At the time, the Chinese government's official stance on scientific theories was one of "leaning towards the Soviet side", and any ideology from the Soviet Union was deemed to be the only truth while everything else would be seen as being invalid. Yuan, as an agricultural student at Southwest University, remained skeptical on both theories and started his own experiments to try and come up with his own conclusions. He is currently the Director-General of the China National Hybrid Rice R&D Center and has been appointed as Professor at Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha. In January 2014, Yuan said in an interview that genetically modified food is the future direction of food and that he had been working on genetic modification of rice.

(Aug. 27, 2018) Unlike the other two datasets, this does not have a many-to-many relation, with a hierarchy. Instead, it contains three relations and the attribute’s parent is the relation it belongs to, again giving a one level hierarchy. To transform these for regression and clustering, word fea-tures were created for 10 out of the 17 columns. "State" was used as a proxy for geographic attributes like "address", to limit feature size (139 features). Unlike the other two datasets, this does not have a many-to-many relation, with a hierarchy.

(12 Jan, 2014) China's "father of hybrid rice", Yuan Longping, says he is working with researchers on rice that has been genetically modified - a controversial technology but one that might help the mainland meet its agricultural goals. "GM is the future. We should not generalise about whether it is harmful," Yuan said in a video about food safety posted recently on the news portal Tencent. But s urveys suggest that many Chinese consumers, like those elsewhere, remain sceptical of GM foods, or at least believe they are entitled to know whether the food on their dinner table uses the technology.

(January 12, 2021) Xu Yan, wife of Yu, first revealed on Twitter that she has brought a ticket from Beijing to Chengdu to attend the hearing scheduled on Wednesday. Several security agents knocked on her door shortly afterwards to ask about her travel plans, while lambasting her for being a “traitor.” Tortured by police, Yu has become handicapped and lost his teeth. Another activist Li Dawei said he cannot attend the hearing, as he was not able to get a ticket and has been closely monitored by officers in his apartment since Tuesday morning. The Sichuan province’s Department of Justice accused Lu of violating the country’s lawyers law by “publishing inappropriate speech online” early this month.

(January 11, 2021) The amendment would also give authorities the power to adopt certain technical measures legally to block information from overseas that is prohibited by law and administrative regulations. The tightening of internet regulations was designed to ensure the absolute safety of the centenary celebration of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party this July, said Baptist University journalism lecturer Bruce Lui. The collapse of the Soviet Union served as a reminder for President Xi Jinping that the ideology of the Communist Party must be protected from foreign interference at all costs, Lui said. The law has become a weapon for China’s leadership, and tightening regulations would create fear among the general public, so as to stop them from breaking the law, he added. It is already more and more difficult for mainland internet users to access information from overseas, Lui said. Authorities would also strengthen their own propaganda or hire trolls to twist the information from foreign media and intellectuals, he added.

(January 10, 2021) Beijing is alleged to have forced many Uighur women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices, apparently to control population growth. China has denied the allegations. The original tweet had linked to an article by China Daily, a state-run newspaper, which alleged the eradication of extremism in Xinjiang "had given Uighur women more autonomy when deciding whether to have children". Former detainees in internment camps, which China says are re-education camps to tackle extremism, said they were given injections that stopped their periods, or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth control drugs.

(January 10, 2021) Zwijnenburg has published several reports compiled using open-source data on the website run by Bellingcat, the headline-making collective perhaps best known for using open-source information to investigate events such as the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Using a range of satellite data from organizations like Planet Labs and Google Earth, "you can get insights into something that may be quite slow-moving but which has major implications — like the losses in agriculture in Yemen. Verheij herself used social media when compiling a case against Vietnamese wildlife poachers for the Wildlife Justice Commission, an investigative organization she helped found. "People were openly advertising illegal wildlife products on Facebook and WeChat," she says. "A lot of these crimes are committed in countries where there is weak governance, a lack of interest or corruption. In some places, government officials are making a lot of money facilitating these crimes." "I'm not sure if turning to the law always works," Verheij concludes.

(January 9, 2021) "We are ready to work with the United States on a joint Marshall Plan for democracy," Maas told the German news agency DPA on Saturday. The original Marshall Plan was a US economic campaign launched in 1948 to rebuild 18 war-torn Western European nations. The US-allied West Germany was among the biggest beneficiaries. "Without democracy in the US, [there is] no democracy in Europe," asserted Maas. "Getting to the roots of the social divisions in our countries is one of the greatest tasks for the future for Americans and Europeans," Maas said. He warned that "the belief in cohesion, in democracy as the most humane form of government, and in the persuasive power of science and reason" can only be preserved together.

(May 2016) Since 2011, the counter measure paper count has almost doubled, but the Trojan design paper count does not grow and even drops a little bit. This might indicate two points: (1) the design of Trojan triggers or payloads has been explored so much that developing novel Trojan attacks has become too challenging, or (2) there are many types of functional Trojans with various triggers or payloads that are still hard to detect, so researchers realize that more effort should be spent on the development of countermeasures. ... In this figure, we can see the general trend shifts from Trojan detection to design-for-trust and split-manufacturing approaches in recent years. ... Basically, there might be two possible ways to build up a secure system based on untrusted COTS components. Some functionality could be identif ied if the design has been explored significantly by a combination of pattern mining from input-output traces and model checking. The second class employs a secure architecture that can realize trusted computations based on untrusted COTS components that could contain hardware Trojans. ... If we can get some ideas about the most possible hardware Trojans that could be inserted into the design at some stages, it will be very helpful to guide designers to improve their designs andincorporate appropriate DfT techniques for detecting or preventing hardware Trojans. However, these analyses are not adequate for an RTL or gate-level design since they do not take the circuit’s function into account during the analysis. For some security-critical modules, such as encryption/decryption blocks, it is necessary to increase their security level at the design phase. Moreover, the hardware Trojan vulnerability analysis can be extended to the system and layout level. ... Several novel Trojan triggers and payloads have been proposed, as discussed in Section 2.1. For example, reliability Trojans are created to radically accelerate device aging. Doping Trojans make hardware Trojans stealthier because they do not introduce additional circuitry into the original design. The emerging 3D ICs can change the current circuit architecture and IC supply chain, and could result in new hardware Trojan attacks.

(July 19, 2007) TMS can be used in a variety of ways to induce plastic changes in the brain, and this can be utilized to assess the capability for plasticity. rTMS at slow rates, approximately between 0.2 and 1 Hz, will cause a decrease in brain excitability. rTMS at faster rates, approximately 5 Hz or faster, will cause an increase in brain excitability. Another method for influencing brain excitability is a low-level continuous electric current, called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). If a median nerve stimulus at the wrist is paired with a TMS to the sensorimotor cortex at 25 ms, then the two stimuli arrive at about the same time, and the MEPs will be facilitated. If the interval is about 10 ms, the TMS comes about 15 ms before the median nerve volley arrives, and the MEP will be depressed. The former behaves like LTP and the latter like LTD. ... TMS can be used with EEG, and in this circumstance both immediate and delayed effects of TMS can be demonstrated on cortical function. For example, TMS was used together with high-density EEG to see how activation of the premotor area is transmitted to the rest of the brain during sleep. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response did not propagate beyond the stimulation site, indicating reduced functional cortical connectivity during sleep. The physiology of visuospatial judgments was assessed with fMRI together with disruptive TMS. There were significant correlations between the induced behavioral impairment and fMRI changes in both the directly stimulated parietal and remote ipsilateral frontal brain regions.

(March 1953) The Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party declares that Communists "must establish wide connections with the masses of workers, peasants, and all other revolutionary people and pay constant attention to strengthening and broadening these connections", and that "every Party member must listen attentively to the voice of the people, understand their urgent needs, and help them to organize in order to struggle for the satisfaction of their needs". A central purpose of Communist propaganda and agitation is to arouse the people to an awareness of their needs (as interpreted to them by the Communists, the "vanguard of the people") and to organize the masses in support of the program and policies of the Communist Party (which presumably reflect the basic needs and aspirations of "the people"). An application of the mass line to state policy in China today appears in the utilization of many "mass organizations" (called "people's organizations") and "mass movements" through which the state maintains touch with the masses and "mobilizes" them in support of its program. ... They are the channels through which the government communicates its wishes and directives to the people and the means by which it organizes the masses for desired action. They are, in effect, powerful organs of state control. The mass action desired at any given time depends on what policy or program the state wishes the people to support.

(January 9, 2021) The website has saved huge amounts of information, articles, photos and videos related to the social unrest, which erupted in June 2019 over a now-withdrawn extradition bill and later morphed into a wider anti-government movement. The website’s chief editor Naomi Chan said HKChronicles began receiving reports from Hong Kong-based users that they could no longer access the site since Wednesday evening, and that the number of visitors from the city had fallen drastically. Chan said based on reports from users, the ISPs involved included SmarTone, China Mobile, HKBN and PCCW. Chan also slammed the ISPs for restricting residents’ right to access information, advising local users to make preparations to counter internet blockage on a larger scale in the future and to “face the darkness before dawn”.

(January 8, 2021) A Chinese general who refused a military order to crack down against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, in 1989, has died in Hebei province, prompting condolences from Chinese democracy activists. At least several hundred people were killed as Chinese troops attacked the protesters, although some estimates put the death toll at more than 1,000. Xu was one of the few military leaders who refused to obey his commander’s order to attack. In his final days, Xu received care at his Shijiazhuang home, where he had lived in exile under 24-hour surveillance by government agents. His biggest regret was that he was never able to publish his own first-person account of what happened during the Tiananmen crackdown, the newspaper learned.

(Accessed January 8, 2021) Peasant insurgents were supposed to throw the countryside into chaos, while workers should take over the county seats, and a general strike would paralyze Guangzhou. The communists in Guangdong later claimed that their insurrection was based on the plans discussed with the party leadership, though historian Hsiao Tso-Liang argued that the former still acted completely autonomous and without the knowledge of the latter. According to CPC leader Zhang Guotao, Neumann came to wield great influence on the committee and took a leading role in the rebellion; others believe that he was just a messenger for Stalin. Nevertheless, rebel forces captured most of the city within hours using the element of surprise, despite a huge numerical and technical advantage held by government troops. The takeover dissolved by the early morning of December 13, 1927. In the resulting purges, many young communists were executed and the Guangzhou Soviet became known as the "Canton Commune", "Guangzhou Commune" or "Paris Commune of the East"; it lasted only a short time at the cost of more than 5,700 communists dead and an equal number missing. Around 8 p.m. on 13 December, the Soviet consulate in Guangzhou was surrounded and all its personnel were arrested. (Guangzhou Uprising — Wikipedia) <br>

(Sept. 26, 1969) In late 1965 and early 1966, Mao faded from view for six months, only to reappear suddenly and launch his disruptive Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Earlier this month, Washington picked up an unconfirmed report that Mao was paralyzed; at about the same time Sinologists in Hong Kong heard rumors, from sources inside and outside China, that he was gravely ill. Within China, Mao's departure could result in a further loosening of Peking's central authority, already curtailed in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. It could also lead to a relaxation of the zealous, puritanical quality of Maoist Communism. Outside the country, there could be significant changes in long-frozen positions on the Sino-Soviet split and China's relations with the U.S. Louis hinted that Moscow, under the Brezhnev Doctrine, had not abandoned the possibility of intervention in China.

(January 7, 2021) China is unaware of the deportation of Chinese nationals from Afghanistan on spying charges, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said, days after the head of Afghanistan’s top intelligence agency spoke about their detention. The chief of Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) told parliament on Monday that he could confirm the arrest of people from a “Chinese network” but said he could not provide details due to the sensitivity of the case. Three high-ranking sources in Afghanistan told Reuters that 13 Chinese nationals, working as construction workers, carpenters and even running a clinic and bakery, were deported.

(December 28, 2020) Corruption and mismanagement at the highest levels of the Iranian regime have produced years of environmental exploitation and degradation, with tragic results for the Iranian people. Limited  access  to  potable  water  and  poor  air  quality  are  among  the  top  concerns  for  many Iranians today. These long-standing environmental issues have also contributed to the tragedy of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and compounded the problems confronting the Iranian people. As it throws billions of dollars into misadventures abroad fueled by the reckless Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Iranian regime neglects the most basic needs at home, including the ability of its people to drink safe water and breathe clean air. Since 1979, Iran has built about 600 dams. In many cases the dams have actually contributed to further environmental damage and the loss of much-needed water from already marginalized communities living on the social and economic margins. The  beneficiaries  of  these  projects  were contractors  from  the  IRGC,  individuals  close  to  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  and  large  agribusinesses, who all got rich as the lake drained. In 2018, Tehran Municipality’s Deputy Director of Transportation and Traffic, Mohsen Pour Seyed Aghaei, said the city’s air pollution costs Iran  over  $2.6  billion  a  year.  According  to  a  2016  World  Bank  report,  the  cities  of  Zabol,  Bushehr, and  Ahvaz are among the most polluted in the world. ...

(December 28, 2020) Similar to the regime’s support for proxies, Iran prioritizes plausible deniability for its malicious cyber activities,  making  attribution  difficult  in  many  cases.  However,  substantial  evidence  exists  of the regime’s malign activity in cyberspace. The  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran  has  developed  its  cyber  capabilities  with  the  intent  to  surveil  and sabotage its adversaries, which is contrary to international norms of responsible state behavior and threatens international stability. The IRGC is frequently  the  main  force  behind  these  cyber  operations,  though  they  often  enlist  hackers  outside of government. The Iranian regime typically focuses on “soft” targets, such as more vulnerable commercial entities, critical infrastructure, and non-governmental organizations. An updated version of that malicious cyber attack was again carried out between 2016 and 2017, resulting in the destruction of Saudi public and private databases, including those belonging to General Authority for Civil Aviation and the Central Bank. Additionally, in 2017, the U.S. Department of Treasury designated involved Iranians under Executive tOrder 13694, for engaging  in  significant  malicious  cyber-enabled  activity,  noting  that  the  individuals  worked  for private  computer  security  companies  affiliated  with  the  IRGC. Mabna Institute hackers also obtained unauthorized access to the computer systems of U.S. federal agencies, U.S. states, the United Nations, the U.N. Children’s Fund, and many domestic and foreign private sector companies. During  the  announcement  of these actions, former U.S. Department of the  Treasury  Under Secretary for  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal Mandelker, said, “Iran is engaged in an ongoing campaign of malicious cyber activity against the United States and our allies.  The IRGC outsourced cyber intrusions to the Mabna Institute,  a  hacker  network  that  infiltrated  hundreds  of  universities  to  steal  sensitive  data.” ... The Iranian regime utilizes its cyber capabilities to deny Iranians unrestricted access to the Internet, including by blocking access to social media sites and applications and conducting internet shutdowns.  The regime funds a massive online censorship apparatus and restricts access to satellite services. In  May  2020, Facebook dismantled another network of over 500 accounts spreading disinformation that were connected to the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). In  August  2018, Facebook, Twitter, and other U.S. companies reported the removal of more than 1,000 pages, groups, and accounts they assessed were engaged in spreading disinformation on behalf of the  regime. On September 17, 2020 the Department of Treasury also designated the Iranian entity Advanced Persistent Threat 39, its front company Rana Intelligence Company, and 45 associated individuals for their use of malicious cyber attacks and tools to target and monitor Iranian citizens, particularly dissidents, journalists, former government employees, environmentalists, students, refugees, and employees of international nongovernmental organizations. They also targeted hundreds of  individuals  and  entities  from  more  than  30  different  countries  from  across  Asia,  Africa, Europe, and North America, including approximately 15 U.S. companies.

(December 28, 2020) Reporters Without Borders  estimated  in  April  2020  that  ten  journalists  and  12  citizen  journalists  remain  in  prison for their work and simply expressing their views.  The regime also restricts the travel and speech  of  high-profile  figures,  including  political  candidates. As they speak out in greater numbers against the government’s corruption and mismanagement of Iran’s natural resources, environmental activists also have come under increasing scrutiny, and have been jailed, and even killed under suspicious circumstances while being detained. Deaths in custody are often reported to occur under suspicious circumstances, and it has been reported that enforced disappearances of members of Iran’s Ahwazi, Azerbaijani, Balochi, and  Kurdish  communities,  among  others,  continue to take place. ... In June 2019, authorities took Shiraz city council member Mehdi Hajati to prison to serve a one-year sentence for “propaganda against the state” following his initial arrest in 2018 for advocating for the release of two detained Baha’is.  The regime released him in January 2020, but arrested him again in March 2020 after he criticized the government’s response to COVID-19 over Twitter. ... The government  frequently  subverts  efforts  to  protect  individual  freedoms  by  limiting  access  to lawyers and directly targeting human rights lawyers in particular. Credible reports indicate the Iranian regime regularly uses torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading forms of punishment, particularly in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which hosts many of Iran’s political prisoners.  In many cases, these judges sentenced political prisoners to death. ... Iran and its partners’ disregard for human rights extends well beyond its borders. Tehran has deployed thousands of soldiers on the ground in Syria—including Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Ground Forces and Artesh (Iran’s regular army)—and utilizes locations like Tiyas and Shayrat airfields in Homs and Al-Kiswah base south of Damascus to launch attacks. For  example,  Kata’ib  Hizballah  is  reported  to  have  kidnapped  and intimidated local Sunni Arab residents in Diyala and Babil Governorates and prevented Sunni Arab internally displaced persons from returning to their homes. Iran’s support of the rebels is helping to prolong the country’s  civil  war,  frustrate  United  Nations  peace  efforts,  and  worsen  an  already  devastating  humanitarian tragedy.

(December 28, 2020) The IAEA revealed additional details in November 2019, when it reported that it had detected chemically-processed uranium particles at a location in Iran not declared to the IAEA. While the IAEA continues to evaluate Iran’s latest explanation for the presence of these uranium particles, it is both worrying and very telling that well over a year into the Agency’s investigation into this location, and despite multiple engagements by the IAEA to seek clarification,  Iran  has  thus  far  proven  unwilling  or  unable  to  conclusively  answer  the  Agency’s questions  about  the  activities  that  occurred  there,  the  origin  and  presence  of  those  particles  at this location, and the current whereabouts of any items that may have been their source. ... For years after the initial revelations in 2002 of covert Iranian nuclear activities, Iran hid evidence of its safeguards violations and refused to come clean in the face of overwhelming evidence of its past covert nuclear weapons-related activities. ... [T]hat  the  state  currently  in  question  has  a  woeful  record  over  multiple  decades  of  secretly  undertaking  nuclear weapons work and  hiding  nuclear  material  from  the  IAEA  only  further  amplifies  the  gravity  of  the  situation.  Robust  verification  is  the  core  of  the global  nonproliferation  regime  and the bedrock on which any durable diplomatic solution to Iran’s nuclear program must be built.

(December 28, 2020) In  one  case,  IRGC-QF  set  up  a network of front companies to exploit the currency exchange market in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to procure and transfer hundreds of millions in U.S.-dollar denominated bulk cash.  The network forged documents and disguised its conduct behind legitimate businesses. In  addition,  IRGC-QF  officials  used  ROHSI’s  funds  to  supplement IRGC-QF budgets, likely embezzling public donations intended for the construction and maintenance  of  Shiite  shrines  in  Iraq. The  IRGC-QF’s  illicit  financing  schemes  are  facilitated  at  the  highest  levels  of  Iran’s  government, including through the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).  Since at least 2016, the IRGC-QF has received the vast majority of its foreign currency from the CBI, and senior CBI officials have worked directly with the  IRGC-QF to facilitate  CBI’s  financial support to the IRGC-QF. This scheme by the IRGC not only fueled terrorism, it also undermined the integrity of Iraq’s  financial  system  and  therefore  Iraq’s  economic  growth  and  development. Despite the  fact  that  the NDF was established to serve  the welfare  of  the Iranian people by allocating revenues that originated from selling natural resources to durable wealth and productive economic investments,  in  reality, the NDF was  used  as  a  slush  fund for the IRGCQF. In 2017, the IRGCQF engineered a plot to print and distribute counterfeit currency  and  flout  the  laws  of  European  countries. It deceived European suppliers by using a series of companies in Germany to conceal its  identity and end-user data to procure advanced printing machinery and other necessary materials. ... The Islamic Republic has continually failed to implement international standards to combat money laundering  and  terrorist  financing. The  FATF  generously  gave  Iran  more  than  sufficient  time  to  correct  its  deficiencies,  should  it have chosen to do so. One Iranian legislator said in June 2019 that “It is not in the interest of the country to place information from the whole banking  system  and  financial  transactions  at  the  disposal  of  others”  because  there  were  “important security aspects.” The “security aspects” referenced by the legislator refer to Iran’s continued practice of its large-scale illicit financing schemes to fund its malign activities. [I]n February 2020 the FATF lifted its suspension of countermeasures, calling on all jurisdictions to impose effective countermeasures on Iran such as requiring financial institutions to review, amend, or if necessary terminate correspondent relationships with Iranian banks or limiting business relationships or financial transactions with Iran.

(March 3, 1999) Queen Catherine: I grow weary of this war. So do the necromancers. (From Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia — New World Computing) <br>

李逵心裏忖道：「我從梁山泊歸來，特為老娘來取他，千辛萬苦，背到這裏，卻把來與你喫了。那鳥大蟲拖著這條人腿，不是我娘的，是誰的？」心頭火起，赤黃鬚豎立起來，將手中朴刀挺起來，搠那兩個小虎。這小大蟲被搠得慌，也張牙舞爪鑽向前來，被李逵手起，先搠死了一個。那一個望洞裏便鑽了入去，李逵趕到洞裏，也搠死了。李逵卻鑽入那大蟲洞內，伏在裏面張外面時，只見那母大蟲張牙舞爪望窩裏來。李逵道：「正是你這業畜喫了我娘。」放下朴刀，胯邊掣出腰刀。那母大蟲到洞口，先把尾去窩裏一剪，便把後半截身軀坐將入去。李逵在窩內看得仔細，把刀朝母大蟲尾底下盡平生氣力捨命一戳，正中那母大蟲糞門。李逵使得力重，和那刀靶，也直送入肚裏去了。 (水滸傳 第四十三回) <br>

(January 7, 2021) The US House of Representatives and Senate on Thursday certified Joe Biden's election as US president and Kamala Harris as vice president. "To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today — you did not win," said Pence after lawmakers returned to the Senate chamber. "Let's get back to work," he added. Wednesday's violent attack on the Capitol caused several Republican lawmakers to reverse their opposition to certifying Biden's victory.

Twitter has temporarily blocked the president from using his own account. "I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted.

(Accessed January 6, 2021) The national debt of the United States is the total debt, or unpaid borrowed funds, carried by the federal government of the United States, which is measured as the face value of the currently outstanding Treasury securities that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies. As of August 31, 2020 federal debt held by the public was $20.83 trillion and intragovernmental holdings were $5.88 trillion, for a total national debt of $26.70 trillion. The United States has the largest external debt in the world. As of June 2020, the total of U.S. Treasury bonds held by foreign countries was $7.04 trillion, up from $6.63 trillion in June 2019. As of August 2020, the largest foreign holders were Japan ($1.278 trillion), China ($1.068 trillion), United Kingdom ($419 billion), and Ireland ($335 billion). (National debt of the United States — Wikipedia) <br>

(December 28, 2020) On April 15, 2019, the United States designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in its entirety, including its Qods Force (IRGC-QF), as  a  Foreign  Terrorist  Organization  (FTO).  The  designation  was  the  first  time  that  the  United States has ever named a part of another government as an FTO. In  November  2019,  Iranian  agents  assassinated  a  dissident  Iranian journalist living in Turkey. Where it is does not act directly, the Iranian regime has mastered the use of terrorist partner and proxy groups to conduct attacks, often through unconventional means. Lebanese Hizballah is Iran’s most powerful terrorist partner. Since its successful 2012 attack in Bulgaria, Hizballah has  conducted  terrorist  plotting  on  five  continents,  with  plots  disrupted  in  Azerbaijan,  Cyprus, Guinea,  Kuwait,  Nigeria,  Panama,  Peru,  Thailand,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States, among others. ... The  IRGC  recruits  foreign  fighters  to  increase  its  influence  abroad. Multiple organizations continue to document the IRGC’s tactic of coercing Afghan migrants to serve  as  foreign  fighters. IranWire  reported in an April 2020 interview in with former Afghan child soldiers, who were 17 and 15 years old when  recruited  in  Tehran,  that  they  were  dispatched  for  fighting  in  Syria  multiple  times  to fight  alongside  President  Bashar  Al-Assad’s  forces  and  received  a  three-week  training  in  guerrilla warfare  tactics  by  the  IRGC  in  Yazd  prior  to  their  tours. The  airline has also provided private transportation to senior  IRGC-QF  officials  like  former  Qods  Force commander Qassem Soleimani, allowing them to bypass UN-mandated travel restrictions as well as normal security and manifest procedures in contravention of international standards of aviation security. Following the declaration of the coronavirus  pandemic,  Mahan  Air’s  continued  flights  to  China,  Syria,  and  Lebanon  contributed  to  the spread of the deadly virus. ... After a brief lull in the 1990s and early 2000s, Iran has ramped up its active involvement in worldwide terrorist activities, with numerous terrorist operations uncovered or disrupted in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia since 2009.

(December 28, 2020) The Iranian regime’s threat to regional security is evident in its operational use of ballistic missiles in open attacks against U.S. service members in Iraq  in  2020  and  targets  in  Iraq  and  Syria  in  2018,  and  its  employment  of  land  attack  cruise  missiles against Saudi refineries in September 2019. ... Thus  far in 2020, Iran conduced a test of its Simorgh SLV in February, and most recently, in April, Iran’s IRGC conducted a space launch from a mobile system that it claimed placed a military satellite into orbit, contradicting their previous claims that they did not have a military space program. As with Iran’s ballistic missile launches, its SLV tests have been condemned at the Security Council by the United States, as well as by  France,  Germany,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Israel as in defiance of UNSCR 2231. ... Since  the beginning of 2017,  the  United  States  imposed  sanctions  on a  total  of  thirty-three  foreign  entities,  mostly  in  China,  for  transferring  equipment  to  Iran’s missile program.

(November 26, 1865) Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.” The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. “And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well. (Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, CHAPTER XI Who Stole the Tarts?) <br>

(January 6, 2021) Former defence head of China analysis Paul Monk says the “real work” which China is trying to carry out in Australia is not simply trying to get ethnic Chinese into positions of influence, but rather winning leading Australians. “Much of our Chinese community came here from the PRC – or for that matter elsewhere in Asia – because they wanted what this country had to offer,” Mr Monk told Sky News host Cory Bernardi. “What the Communist Party has been doing is not so much using any significant proportion of that community for its nefarious purposes, but rather seeking to intimidate it, to infiltrate it, to take over its independent media, and that’s something we want to protect.” (China’s ‘real work’ aims to ‘win’ leading Australians: Monk — Sky News Australia on YouTube) <br>

(January 5, 2021) In his new book, The Invention of China, journalist Bill Hayton reconstructs the nation-building process of modern China. He shows how nationalist-minded intellectuals and activists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries took up Western concepts of people, language, territory and history, among other things, to paint a picture of a millennia-old nation-state that, in fact, never existed. For significant periods of the past 5,000 years, there were entirely separate states and peoples living on the territory of what is now China. The idea that there's been a single state called China, a single nation going back to ancient history, isn't supported by the evidence. And Xi now seems committed to the idea that there has to be a single way of being Chinese, a single way of being part of the Chinese nation, and he's going to impose that with a very heavy hand. It's really important for them to project continuity back from the past because it cuts down the possibility of criticizing the current situation. If you can convince people that things have always been this way, then there's no reason for them to question why they shouldn't continue to be this way in the future. And this use of history is possibly the most important psychological tool in the in the toolkit of the People's Republic. The idea that you could try to re-educate a million people is not something that we've ever seen in any other colonial situation. And they are trying to stop discussion of alternatives not just in their own country, but also in other countries. Companies are penalized if they, for example, mention Taiwan as a separate place on their websites. Universities get into trouble if they allow the Dalai Lama to come and speak on their campus. I think we have to insist on our own values and stand up to our own beliefs. We must also insist on the right to ask questions, to have different points of view and so forth.

(December 28, 2020) Vulnerable Shia and Alawi populations, under pressure from ISIS, welcomed the security of Shia militias supported by Iran. The grave abuses of Iranian-backed Shia militia and Assad’s forces, in turn, convinced vulnerable Sunni populations that ISIS protection was their only recourse. Iranian malign  influence  and  activities  in  Syria,  coupled  with  the  failure  of  the  Assad  regime  to  secure  and serve the Syria people, have ensured that the grievances that ISIS exploited have not been resolved and have only deepened, thereby enabling the regeneration of ISIS. ... Iran  has  sought  to  prolong  the  conflict  to  challenge  its  main  regional  rival,  Saudi  Arabia. U.S. naval forces have interdicted multiple shipments of Iranian weapons bound for the Houthis  in  Yemen. Iranian  supported  UAV  and  missile  attacks  from  Yemen  have  undermined  peace  efforts  and  have threatened  to  escalate  the  conflict  even  further. The Iranian hand in  these  recent  attacks  is  evident  in  recovered  missile  debris  from  several  attacks  that  are  unique  to Iranian missiles, including components stamped with a logo signifying the letters SBI, used by the Iranian company Shahid Bagheri Industries. ... Iran’s support for Palestinian terrorist groups serves only to further its own strategic interests and threaten our partner and ally Israel while coming at a high cost to the Palestinian people. ...

“Down with the six theologians, with their white surplices!” “Are those the theologians? I thought they were the white geese given by Sainte-Geneviève to the city, for the fief of Roogny.” “Down with the doctors!” “Down with the cardinal disputations, and quibblers!” “My cap to you, Chancellor of Sainte-Geneviève! You have done me a wrong. ’Tis true; he gave my place in the nation of Normandy to little Ascanio Falzapada, who comes from the province of Bourges, since he is an Italian.” “That is an injustice,” said all the scholars. “Down with the Chancellor of Sainte-Geneviève!” ...

Cai, a former professor of the CCP’s top academy, called the amendments a setback of the party. “The idea is to better control the party, not to allow democratic rights of party members,” she told Radio Free Asia. It also stressed that party members should adhere to “Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.” “It means that all 90 million party members should revolve around its leader … that’s why I think the party has become a zombie and the 90 million are now slaves,” Cai said.

(January 5, 2021) With Chevron and perhaps ExxonMobil heading for the exits, active exploration at a virtual standstill and production on an increasingly downward spiral, Indonesia’s government needs to conduct radical regulatory surgery before its oil and gas industry is doomed by the onrushing era of renewable energy. Exploration has fallen by an average of 23% over the past decade. According to government data, the number of exploratory wells plunged from 64 in 2014 to 26 in 2019 and only 18 last year, partly because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and partly as a result of sagging global oil and gas prices. Inpex turned down an overture from the China National Overseas Oil Corp (CNOOC) for political, technical and what one source describes as “bad business chemistry issues,” leaving the company to contemplate at least a decade-long delay in developing Marsela’s Abadi field. In particular, they want to see significant changes to the cost recovery scheme, under which the government reimburses companies for upstream-related costs in exchange for a higher share – up to 85% — for each company’s earnings from oil and gas blocks. “In other words, Indonesia can choose to implement incentives and measures which it believes will make it more attractive (as countries like Egypt and Columbia have done in recent years), or wait to negotiate with foreign investors from an increasingly weak bargaining position.” (Death knell tolls for Indonesia’s oil and gas — Asia Times) <br>

(January 5, 2021) Ellen and Rafael Robles tried to have everything in order for Monday morning when their son, Bento, started school virtually after the holiday break rather than in person: a good desk, chair, headphones and an iPad. "He's working at her [home] office with her computer, and she's working from his desk with his iPad," said Rafael Robles. It can be tough getting back into school routines following the winter break, but students in Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario are facing additional challenges this week due to the fact that they're hitting the books virtually — for at least a week — rather than returning in person, a measure several education ministries announced late last year to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

(January 5, 2021) Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The tiny, gas- and oil-rich state denied the accusation and rejected the conditions for ending the partial blockade, including closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera broadcast network. Qatar's only land border was closed; ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports; and much of the region's airspace was closed to Qatari aircraft. Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait served as a mediator in the dispute. Kuwaiti mediation efforts appeared to make little progress until late last year, when the Trump administration intensified pressure on all sides for an end to the stand-off that thwarted their efforts to assemble an alliance of Sunni-led states to counter Iran and its proxies.

(January 5, 2021 Leaders of the Gulf countries signed a document, although the contents were not immediately released. Ahead of the gathering, Kuwait had announced that Saudi Arabia, which along with allies boycotted Doha in mid-2017, would reopen its airspace and borders to Qatar. All the states are U.S. allies. Qatar hosts the region’s largest U.S. military base, Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host U.S. troops. ...

(January 5, 2021) The provincial government-run Hebei Daily said the province had entered “wartime mode”, meaning investigation teams would be set up at provincial, city and district levels to trace the close contacts of those who have tested positive. Hebei would resolutely act as the “political moat” around Beijing and strictly prevent the virus from spreading outside the province, the report said. Beijing is scheduled to host China’s annual parliamentary meeting in March. Last year’s gathering was postponed by more than two months because of the coronavirus outbreak.

(January 3, 2021) Hanoi is proceeding with joint drilling ventures with Japanese firms in the disputed waterway despite the failure of similar projects with other countries. But analysts say China is likely to test Vietnam through maritime provocations if the energy ventures go ahead. With field development plans already approved by the Vietnamese government for Blocks 05-1B and 05-1C, production appears to be close at hand. Operations in a nearby field were halted after a deal between PetroVietnam and the Spanish firm Repsol was cancelled in 2017, allegedly under Chinese threats of military attacks. The following year, Repsol pulled out of its final concession with PetroVietnam. But while Vietnamese officials know well the risks that come with drilling in the South China Sea, there is hope in Hanoi that their Japanese business venture will succeed.

(December 28, 2020) President Trump  offered  the  Iranian  regime  a  choice:  either  negotiate  a  new, comprehensive deal or face unprecedented U.S. sanctions and manage economic  collapse.  Since  then, the  Islamic  Republic  chose  the  latter, rejecting diplomacy and doubling  down on its  revolutionary  agenda. Our sanctions have denied Iran more than 90% of its oil export revenue, depriving the regime access to well over $70 billion in income that could have  otherwise  gone  to  fund  terror  operations  –  while  preserving  avenues  for  humanitarian trade  and  assistance. Sadly, since we last published this report, the Iranian regime has found new ways to harm Iranians and recklessly extort the international community. In an attempt to hide its actions from the world, the regime simultaneously imposed a near-total shutdown of access to the internet. We continue to stand with the Iranian people, and have rolled out sanctions  and  visa  restrictions  on  a  host  of  Iranian  officials  directly  responsible  for  the lethal  crackdown  in  November  2019.  Corrupt  and  repressive  regime  officials,  not  the  Iranian people, are the targets of the Maximum Pressure Campaign. (A LETTER FROM U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE, MICHAEL  R.

(January 3, 2021) The 11 Republican senators and senators-elect, led by Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. Citing a precedent from 1877 - when a bi-partisan committee was formed to investigate after both parties claimed victory in three states - they urged Congress to appoint a commission for an "emergency 10-day audit of election returns in the disputed states". Mr Pence "welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people", Mr Short said. "I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?" [Romney] said in a statement.

(January 3, 2021) Germany, by December 17, had signed off on permissions to export weapons and military equipment worth €752 million to Egypt. Permission was also granted to German arms companies for deals worth over €305.1 million to Qatar, over €51 million to the United Arab Emirates, €23.4 million for Kuwait and around €22.9 million to Turkey. Licenses were granted to Jordan totaling €1.7 million and Bahrain amounting to €1.5 million. The United Nations humanitarian office puts the number of those who have died as a result of the 6-year-old war in Yemen at an estimated 233,000. This includes 131,000 from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure.

(January 2, 2021) A domestic high-speed rail network in Malaysia alone is not feasible and likely to end up a white elephant if it is built, transport analysts said. The Malaysian government had, prior to the expiry of the suspension period of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project, announced that it will conduct a study on the viability of a domestic HSR network, with the line ending in Johor Baru in Malaysia instead of Jurong East in Singapore.

(January 1, 2021) China has rebuffed the latest offer of talks from Taiwan, saying the government was engaging in a “cheap trick” and provocation by seeking confrontation with China at every turn. China says it is responding to “collusion” between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the island. Beijing views this as a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China. ('Cheap trick': China rebuffs latest Taiwan offer of talks — Reuters) <br>

(January 1, 2021) This remains short of the 90% required to make a nuclear bomb. But under the 2015 agreement Iran was supposed to keep enrichment below 4%. Iran breached the 3.67% purity cap imposed by the nuclear deal in 2019 but the enrichment level had remained steady at up to 4.5% since then. However the increase to 20% was mandated in a law passed by Iran's parliament last month ... The bill required the Iranian government to resume enriching uranium to 20% if sanctions on the country's oil and financial sectors were not eased in two months. The 2015 deal - signed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US - was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief. President Trump pulled out of the agreement in May 2018, calling it "decaying and rotten". However the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China all hope it can be revived.

(December 30, 2020) Coming to a South China Sea wartime theater of war soon — ship fired laser weapons, submarine launched drones and hypersonic missiles. Gilday’s comments mirror fast-moving efforts to arm amphibious ships, destroyer ships and even aircraft carriers with low-cost, high-impact offensive and defensive laser weapons, National Interest reported. Lasers are not only stealthy, but they are also precise and scalable, meaning laser bands can be combined to strengthen the attack, increase power, or conversely be set to “stun” or merely disable an enemy asset without needing a full kill. The promise of lasers is even inspiring the Navy to work with the Missile Defense Agency on ultimately developing ship-fired lasers able to take out higher-flying ballistic missiles. ... UUVs used in this role typically have a mixture of sensors, including side-scan sonars and bathymetric sensors, to create detailed maps of the seabed and otherwise identify potential hazards or other objects of interest. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in October that the service will deploy new hypersonic weapons on all 69 of its guided missile destroyers. The new missile, Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), is designed to travel at hypersonic speeds to quickly target emerging threats. Hypersonic speeds are defined as speeds above Mach 5, or 3,836 miles per hour. (US Navy eyes laser weapons, drones and hypersonics — Asia Times) <br>

(July 19, 2007) Short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) are obtained with paired-pulse studies and reflect interneuron influences in the cortex.(Ziemann et al., 1996) In such studies, an initial conditioning stimulus is given—enough to activate cortical neurons, but small enough so that no descending influence on the spinal cord can be detected and there is no MEP. A second test stimulus, at suprathreshold level, follows at a short interval. Intracortical inf luences initiated by the conditioning stimulus modulate the amplitude of the MEP produced by the test stimulus. At very short intervals, less than 5 ms, there is inhibition, and at intervals between 8 and 30 ms, there is facilitation (Figure 6).

(January 1, 2021) The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it will delist three Chinese telecommunications firms based on claimed links with its military. The companies earn all of their revenue in China and have no significant presence in the US. The delisting is seen more as a symbolic blow amid heightened geo-political tensions between the US and China. There are currently more than 200 Chinese companies listed on US stock markets with a total market capitalization of $2.2tn (£1.6tn). (Wall Street to kick out Chinese telecom giants — BBC) <br>

(January 1, 2021) Costs for the Games have increased by $2.8bn (£2.1bn) because of measures needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus but organisers have ruled out a delay.

(December 31, 2020) The hackers behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack managed to escalate access inside Microsoft's internal network and gain access to a small number of internal accounts, which they used to access Microsoft source code repositories, the company said on Thursday.

(December 31, 2020) The House of Representatives asked a federal judge in Texas on Thursday to dismiss a Republican congressman’s lawsuit seeking to give Vice President Mike Pence the power to decide which electoral votes to count when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to finalize November’s presidential election. Mr. Gohmert named Mr. Pence as the sole defendant, which the Justice Department noted is “ironically the very person whose power they seek to promote.” According to a court filing, Mr. Gohmert’s lawyers attempted to reach an agreement with Mr. Pence regarding the lawsuit, but those discussions were unsuccessful.

(Dec 22, 2020) This bill became the vehicle for passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a major government funding bill, which also included economic stimulus provisions due to the coronavirus pandemic. The bill passed overwhelmingly and with bipartisan support in the House through two roll call votes on Dec. 21, 2020. The first vote was on the portion of the bill for the appropriations for some federal departments including Commerce, Justice, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security, and some federal components including the White House and the District of Columbia. The second vote was on the remaining portion of the bill, which included appropriations for the remainder of the federal government as well as coronavirus stimulus and relief and many other miscellaneous provisions. It also passed the Senate overwhelmingly late that night. This bill was originally introduced as the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act.

(May 2016) In 2008, Adee reported that a critical failure in Syrian radar might have been intentionally triggered through a “back door” hidden within a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microprocessor. According to a U.S. defense contractor who spoke on condition of anonymity, a“European chip maker” recently built such microprocessors with remote kill switches for just such purposes. Given the dire consequences associated with such weaknesses, the so-called hardware Trojan issue has received considerable attention from academia, industry, and government over the last decade. ICs that are “infected” by a hardware Trojan may experience changes to their functionality or specification, may leak sensitive information, or may experience degraded or unreliable performance. In general, a Trojan contains two basic parts: trigger and payload [Jin and Makris 2008]. A Trojan trigger is an optional part that monitors various signals and/or a series of events in the circuit. The payload usually taps signals from the original (Trojan-free) circuit and the output of the trigger. Once the trigger detects an expected event or condition, the payload is activated to perform malicious behavior.

(Jul 13, 2003) With June and Jennifer there was the same desire but theirs was a more complex reflection. For them to look in the mirror was often to see their own image dissolve and distort into that of their identical twin. For moments, sometimes hours, they would feel possessed by the other, so profoundly that they felt their personalities switching and their souls merging. It was at the age of 29 (ironically the same age as the very different Bijani twins) that June and Jennifer made their fatal pact. One of them would have to die in order to set the other free. The question was, who would make the sacrifice - or should both? The reaction of June to Jennifer's unexplained death was as I had anticipated; she was of course grief-stricken, wrote poems of deep mourning and felt keenly the loss of the person with whom she had shared her life. 'We were war-weary,' she said. 'It had been a long battle - someone had to break the vicious circle.' Despite the contrast in the two cases, there are haunting parallels. Both cast an eerie illumination over the nature of human identity; of the need for boundaries between individuals, and the price to be paid when one human being is or becomes too closely coupled physically and emotionally with another.
